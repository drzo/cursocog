/// requires having a temporary atomspace, treated as a scratch space,
/// to hold temporary results. These are then discarded, after the
/// match is confirmed or denied. The issue is that creating an
/// atomspace (was) CPU-intensive (it's pretty small, now), so its
/// cheaper to just have a cache of empty atomspaces, hanging around,
/// and ready to go. The code in this section implements this.
///
/// XXX FIXME. Performance has not been recently measured; there
/// have been a lot of redesigns since when this utility was created.
/// It is not at all clear that the code here takes less CPU/RAM than
/// simply creating new AtomSpaces on the fly. For now, we keep this
/// code, as a historical precedent. But performance measurements should
/// be done, and if there is no savings, this code should be trashed.
