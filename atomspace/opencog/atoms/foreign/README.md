Foreign Abstract Syntax Trees
=============================
The source code of almost any programming language can be converted into an
"[abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)".
The AtomSpace stores trees. Therefore, in principle, almost any system
can be mapped onto the AtomSpace. All that is missing is the pretty-printing:
the ability to ingest those trees into the AtomSpace, and then print them
back out, in proper form.

Examples of systems with obvious tree like-structures include JSON, YAML,
datalog, s-expressions and XML.  Of course, you could map any language
(including python and java) into trees; just that the above are
conventionally used to hold some kind of data. The primary reason you
would want to map such data-holding languages into the AtomSpace would
be to make use of the query engine, to perform data searches on them.

The code here is an early-stage experiment to perform that mapping. It
is currently at the proof-of-concept stage. The demos work.

The primary unresolved issue is whether this is a worthwhile project.
The mappings are doable; they're just not that hard. Clearly, the next
step would be to map the corresponding query language, such as GraphQL
or the grakn.ai DataDB for the JSON subset, or SparQL for the XML
subset.  Mapping these onto the AtomSpace query engine should not be
that hard: the query engine provides a superset of the tools that these
other systems provide. It might even be faster! The primary issue is
that its a bit ... boring.  Unless someone has a particular use-case
in mind, there's not much of a point to this, right?

This project *might* be able to resolve one sticky aspect of the current
Atomese design: the problem of embedded Python and scheme code, and,
more generally, the problem of of executable syntax trees. Right now,
these are handled in an ad-hoc fashion, case-by-case, with custom code
and in an interpreted fashion (a REPL loop). If, instead of having a
hard-coded Atomese PlusLink and GreaterThanLink and so-on, if we could
just map the native scheme symbols for these (or the native Python
symbols for these) into Atomese, the results of any queries would then
be valid scheme (or python) that could be directly executed. We could
cache byte-code locally, and get high-performance execution of the
results.  This aspect of the project might be worth it. Maybe.

TODO
----
The code here is a proof-of-concept. A slightly more usable API could
be something similar to or even fully compatible with "OGRE", the
[Open Generic Representation](http://binaryanalysisplatform.github.io/bap/api/odoc/ogre/Ogre/index.html)
We already have all the needed bits and parts (DefineLink, ArrowLink,
SignatureLink, etc.) it just needs to have a pretty user API wrapped
around it.

Parsing
-------
This directory contains three or four different parsers. They are all
ad-hoc, hand-written. It would probably be better to use yacc or lex
or something like that, but I am too lazy to futz with that.
Proper engineering would fix this.

Datalog
-------
Datalog is an assertion-only subset of Prolog. Expressions such as
`:- cousin(Tom, Sue)` can be easily mapped to the Atomese expression
`(Evaluation (Predicate "cousin") (List (Concept "Tom") (Concept "Sue")))`
The code here just performs that mapping, and nothing more.
