/**
 * Execute a QueryLink
 *
 * Given a QueryLink containing variable declarations, a predicate and
 * an implicand, this method will "execute" the implication, matching
 * the predicate, and creating a grounded implicand, assuming the
 * predicate can be satisfied. Thus, for example, given the structure
 *
 *    QueryLink
 *       VariableList
 *          VariableNode "$var0"
 *          VariableNode "$var1"
 *       AndList
 *          etc ...
 *
 * The whole point of the QueryLink is to do nothing more than
 * to indicate the bindings of the variables, and (optionally) limit
 * the types of acceptable groundings for the variables.
 *
 * Use the default implicator to find pattern-matches. Associated truth
 * values are completely ignored during pattern matching; if a set of
 * atoms that could be a ground are found in the atomspace, then they
 * will be reported.
