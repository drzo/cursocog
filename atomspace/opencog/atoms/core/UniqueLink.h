/// The UniqueLink is used to guarantee uniqueness of a relationship
/// between the first Atom in the outgoing set, and the rest of the
/// outgoing set. This uniqueness constraint is enforced at the time
/// of AtomSpace insertion. Thus, only ONE UniqueLink, with a given
/// first-Atom, can exist in a AtomSpace at a time.
///
/// The uniqueness constraint is thread-safe: in general, the first
/// such UniqueLink "wins", and blocks subsequnt ones. Thus, they can
/// be used to build more complex thread-safe Link types.
///
/// This class is intended to be the base class for GrantLink, which
/// is used to issue unique names for things, the DefineLink, which
/// is used to define procedures, predicates and schemas, and StateLink,
/// which is used to maintain current state. It is also used by
/// TypedAtomLink to ensure that an atom, if it is typed, has a single,
/// unique type definition.
///
/// This is a "private" Link type, means as a building block for other
/// Link types that enforce different kinds of uniqueness semantics.
/// This includes mutatibility within a single AtomSpace (StateLinks
/// are mutable, DefineLinks and GrantLinks are not) and mutability
/// via Frames (StateLinks and DefineLinks in deeper Frames can be
/// hidden by shallower StateLinks and DefineLinks; however, GrantLinks
/// are the same in all frames.)
