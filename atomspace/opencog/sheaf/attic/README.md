The code here provided an implementation of the "sheaf" ideas presented
in the directory below. This code is now unused and is obsolete. The
[opencog/learn](https://github.com/opencog/learn) project provides a
superior implementation of the general ideas.

The code here still works; it is still usable. It is hard to imagine
any circumstances that would bring it back to life, but perhaps there
might be some, as more abstract domains are tackled. It's placed here,
rather than buried in git history, as a memorium.
