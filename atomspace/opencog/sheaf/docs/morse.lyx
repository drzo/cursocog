\begin_layout Title
Morse Theory and Modal Logic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepstas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Probabilistic inference has issues with combinatoric explosion: if some
 premise is very unlikely, but still has a probability greater than zero,
 then the consequences of that premise must be explored.
 This makes practical algorithms for probabilistic inference computationally
 difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This text proposes that perhaps ideas from Morse theory (and perhaps Floer
 homology) can be mashed up with modal logic to obtain insights that might
 make probailistic computations easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
At this time, this text is little more than a collection of definitions
 and some very basic sketches of some ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text combines three distinct mathematical topics with which the reader
 might not be familiar with, and so a short sketch seems called for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Probabilistic Logic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

probabilistic logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used as an umbrella term for any kind of inference system that does
 not use crisp true/false logic.
 This includes Bayesian inference, Markovian models, fuzzy logic, possibility
 logic, systems such as Ben Goertzel's Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN)
 or Pei Wang's Non-axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS).
 These are all conventional reasoning systems, in that they start with some
 sets of facts, to which are assigned one or more floating point numbers,
 and a collection of inference rules, which can combine facts to form new
 facts.
 The floating point numbers typically range from zero to one, and are interprete
d as a liklihood or possibility; in the case of PLN, there is a second number,
 the confidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Morse Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Morse theory is conventionally a branch of Riemanian geometry, used to explore
 the shapes of Riemannian manifolds by assigning a single real number to
 each point in the manifold.
 Here, it will be used as an inspiration for a similar idea in the domain
 of logical inference.
 The key point of inspiration is that of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

critical point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider starting with a collection of assertions, each assigned some probabilit
y, and a collection of inference rules, that take as input a few of the
 assertions and generate a new statement, assigned some probability which
 is obtained from some formula associated with that particular inference
 rule.
 One can imagine this system to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if the outcomes don't change much under small perturbations of the assigned
 probabilities, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unstable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if they vary wildly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be made more concrete is several ways.
 One way is to pick a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and to reject all inferences that have a probability of less than 
\begin_inset Formula $p.$
\end_inset

 That is, if an inference is unlikely, it is taken to be false, or impossible.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is varied from 0.0 to 1.0, clearly more and more inferences will be rejected,
 and the grand total number of inferences possible is a discontinuous function
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p.$
\end_inset

 Those values 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 where the number of inferences change are referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

critical points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observe that there are manifold-like surfaces in this system.
 That is, each input premise 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 has it's own distinct probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

, and the probability of any conclusion is some complicated (real-valued)
 function of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This function is almost-everywhere continuous and almost-everywhere smooth
 (for most 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

typical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reasoning systems).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A geometric character arises from the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

confluence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Term rewriting systems are generically 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

confluent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that the same inference can be reached via multiple paths.
 This suggests the possibility of homologies or homological arguments being
 applied to collections of inference chains.
 This is clouded by the fact that some inference chains can be homotopic,
 and others are not.
 A more precise articulation requires the use of concepts such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scott continuity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scott topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (see Wikipedia) and homotopy type theory (see the HoTT book).
 Inspirationally, one can think of a particular inference chain as a kind
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

geodesic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Confluence is the convergence of multiple inference chains on the same
 location, resembling the convergence of geodesics at a critical point in
 conventional Morse theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the goal here is to convert these inspirational observations
 into practical tools that could be deployed to control inference in practical
 situations.
 An example might be the use of a SAT solver (these are very fast) to prune
 the inference problem to a manageable size, and then restore the probabilistic
 formulas at each step.
 This vaguely resembles some of the workings used in Satisfiability Modulo
 Theories (SMT) technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Modal Logic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The act of inference can be considered to be a special case of modal logic.
 To hand-wave a bit: if it is possible to make an inference, then that inference
 belongs to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

possible world
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and that possible world is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accessible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the premises.
 If an inference occurs in every accessible world, then it is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

necessary inference
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That is, modal logic provides the vocabulary for discussing the invariant
 properties of the graphical network of logical inferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The introduction of probabilistic inference alters the structure and interpretat
ion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

possible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

necessary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as possible worlds can be assigned probabilisitic values, and accessibility
 relations alter probabilities.
 Whether or not a particular accessibility relation exists becomes dependent
 on the Morse cutoff.
 Again, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

critical points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are those cutoffs where accessibility relations appear or disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of modal logic does not offer much beyond the core Morse-theoretic
 insight, above.
 What it does offer is some vocabulary and a viewpoint 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

from above
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the inference process: it offers a way of thinking about the global
 structure of inference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Now what?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Great! Some terms have been defined, an an inspirational idea has been sketched.
 Now what? Well, that's it, for now.
 You are on your own.
 Converting this inspiration into something usable is the hard part, eh?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Clarifications and Remarks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some clarifications and remarks are in order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Axioms This text will mostly avoid the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

axiom
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and use the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

assumption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fact
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

statement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

evidence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in it's place.
 This is for several reasons.
 In conventional mathematial logic, one distinguishes between logical and
 non-logical axioms.
 An example of a logical axiom might be 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow\left(B\rightarrow A\right)$
\end_inset

, whereas an example of a non-logical axiom is 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b=b+a$
\end_inset

.
 Neither of these seem appropriate when one falters into the domain of natural
 language and common sense, where axioms take the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\vdash likes\left(John,baseball\right).$
\end_inset

 which is to be read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is true that John likes baseball
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Even this is wrong: probabilistic logics make statements such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is a probability of 0.9 that John likes baseball
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is in turn an oversimplification of possible world-model statements
 belief system (epistemic logic): 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

based on the evidence at hand, you and I believe that John likes baseball,
 probably.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 To call such complex statements 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

axioms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems strange.
 (We are already getting tangled here: the above is framed as an inference:
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

evidence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John talks about baseball a lot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, from which we infer that he likes it.
 Or rather, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you and I have heard a rumour that John talks about baseball a lot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which only moves us further from the axiomatic foundations of truth into
 the domain of sense-perception and world-model building.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Entailment The use of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entailment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the turnstile symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\vdash$
\end_inset

 should generally be understood to be in the sense of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

syntactic consequence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

syntactic entailment.
 This is because, in the current context, it's difficult to build up enough
 of a mechanism to define models, in the model-theoretic sense, or of interpreta
tions.
 There is not (yet?) enough machinery present to define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semantic entailment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the double-turnstile symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\models$
\end_inset

.) More broadly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entailment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a property of the logic system in use, and most probabilistic logics
 do not have entailment in them, 
\emph on
per se
\emph default
.
 For example, in Bayesian inference, one does not normally speak of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entailment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Neither does one in probabilistic programming, even if its in the form
 of probabilistic lambda calculus.
 Thus, entailment is used only loosely here, as a stand-in for more specific
 types of probabilistic relations in the probabilistic logic being contemplated.

\begin_layout Description
Inference The rules of inference are meant to be taken as distinct from
 implication and entailment.
