Attic
-----

This is the attic. This is hwere we put dead code ... which was just
hard enough to write that we don't want to just .. throw it away, just
yet. So, its a place for curios.

Currently, its just ... the proxy code. It worked. It just wasn't
flexible. It was hard to extend and configure. The ProxyNode idea is
vastly superior; it's implemented in the base AtomSpace persist module.
