Examples
--------
The [websockets](./websockets) subdirectory contains a web page that
shows how to interact with a running cogserver.  Just load the
[demo.html](./websockets/demo.html) page in a browser, and go.
All the actual network i/o is done with the
[script.js](./websockets/script.js) javascript file.

The [module](./module) subdirectory provides a template for creating
a custom module. Most developers should NOT be interested in this
example! If you want to create a new shell, similar to the python,
scheme or json shells, then look at the code for those, and emulate what
you find there.
