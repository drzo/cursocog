Diary and Other Texts
=====================

A diary of research results, plus an assortment of other theoretical and
experimental texts can be found here. In order of importance & relevance.

* [***Grammar Induction***](agi-2022/grammar-induction.pdf) --
  AGI 2022 theoretical paper on how to induce grammatical structure
  from unstructured sensory data. (10 pages.)
  [Matching slides for talk](agi-2022-talk/topology-grammar.pdf).
  [Transcript](agi-2022-talk/notes.md).
  This repeats much of the talk given at INLP-2021,
  [***Explainable Patterns***](recognizing-patterns.pdf)
  which was very thinly attended.

* [***Grammar Experiments***](inlp-2022/grammar-experiments.pdf) --
  INLP-2022 report on experimental results from above research program.
  (10 pages.)
  [Matching slides](inlp-2022-talk/experimental-results.pdf),
  [Transcript](inlp-2022-talk/notes.md).

* [***Neural-Net vs. Symbolic Machine Learning***](skippy.pdf) --
  (2018) An attempt to build a bridge between these two styles of
  machine learning. The ideas in this paper are foundational for
  the work being performed in this git repo. (75 pages.)

* [***Stitching***](stitching.pdf) --
  (2018) An explanation of how word-vectors can be "stitched together"
  in a non-linear fashion, so as to extract grammatical (syntactic)
  as well as semantic content in the vectors. Describes one stage
  of the processing pipline implemented in this git repo. (13 pages.)

* [***The Distribution of English Language Word Pairs***](word-pairs-2009/word-pairs.pdf) --
  (2009) A report on the statistical distribution of word-pairs for
  English. These experimental results provided the foundational impetus
  for this project.
  (13 pages.)

* [***Word Pair Distributions***](word-pairs-redux/word-pairs-redux.pdf) --
  (2015-2019) A more formal, more complete version of the above. This
  extracts results and graphs from the diary, placing them in one
  single paper, in a more-or-less coherent presentation. Attempts
  to provide "the last word" on this topic, from the point of view of
  this project.  (31 pages.)

* [***Connector Set Distributions***](connector-sets-revised.pdf) --
  (2017) Report of experimental results, characterizing the
  statistical properties and distribution of disjunts
  ("jigsaw pieces") and their connectors, extracted from
  text corpora of varying sizes. (55 pages.)

* [***Meaning as Inverse Interpretation***](interpretation/interpretation.pdf) --
  (2019) In model theory, an "interpretation" provides the "semantic"
  content of a "syntactic" model. This essay argues that humans find
  "meaning" in the inverse direction: by extracting the syntactic
  structure from the jumbled, disordered stream of sensory input.
  (6 pages.)

* [***Messaging***](messaging.pdf) --
  (2021) A loose jumble of ideas connecting communications, grammar,
  and the statistical mechanics of Link Grammar. Attempts to write
  down a partition function. (9 pages.)

* [***Grammar Evaluation Results***](grammar-report/grammar-report.pdf) --
  (2019) Evaluation of the Link Grammar dictionaries obtained from
  the ULL/Kolonin corpora and learning experiments.  (31 pages.)

* [***Learning a Lexis***](lexical/lexical.pdf) --
  (2019) Outline of an unwritten paper that was going to describe this
  project, overall. (5 pages.)

* [Drafts](drafts) -- (2015-2017) A directory containing assorted
  short notes and rough drafts. Some of these are extracts from the
  diary that were requested during specific conversations.

* [***Reading List***](Reading-List.md) --
  A bibliography of notable papers that provide background and
  inspiration for the research being done here.

* [***Entropy***](entropy.pdf) -- Collection of basic definitions and
  notation used elsewhere in these texts. (10 pages.)

Tools
-----
Scheme scripts used to process data to create graphs.
See the diary for a review and explanation of how and when to
use these tools.  These are very specific to reporting results
for the diary, and are not otherwise used in the data processing
pipeline.
