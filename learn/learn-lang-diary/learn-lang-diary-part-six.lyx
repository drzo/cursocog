\begin_layout Title
Language Learning Diary - Part Six
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
Feb 2022 - March 2022
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The language-learning effort involves research and software development
 to implement the ideas concerning unsupervised learning of grammar, syntax
 and semantics from corpora.
 This document contains supplementary notes and a loosely-organized semi-chronol
ogical diary of results.
 The notes here might not always makes sense; they are a short-hand for
 my own benefit, rather than aimed at you, dear reader!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Six of the diary on the language-learning effort re-examines some older
 data from a physical-science, graph-theoretic, information-theoretic viewpoint.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

older data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here is primarily the data for word-pairs.
 The first section defines the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

density of states
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in terms of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are fundamental physics concepts appearing in thermodynamics; they're
 mapped onto the analogous word-pair statistics concepts.
 The second section examines a number of other quantities in this same conceptua
l framework.
 Some of this repeats results reported earlier; here, a more comprehensive
 approach is taken.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an implicit meta-goal, which is not achieved: to provide a statistical-
mechanical, field-theoretic framework for the language data.
 This is explored only at a rather superficial level.
 It feels like deeper analogies are certainly possible, but it is not clear
 how these could offer insight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Summary Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important result presented here is an analysis of the word-pair
 MI distribution.
 For the first time, it becomes clear that it factors into two parts: a
 Gaussian distribution, arising from randomly-paired words, and a log-normal
 distribution, arising from word-pairs that carry actual syntactic information.
 This is obvious, in retrospect, and was always visible; just that now,
 we have an rough explanation for the shape.
 Here's the relevant graph, in full glory; it is explained towards the end
 of the chapter.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter starts with definitions of some abstract concepts, followed
 by some data analysis.
 In order of appearance (and not in order of importance):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The product topology.
 The space of natural-language sentences is simply the collection of ordered
 strings of words.
 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sentence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is just the Cartesian product of words in a vocabulary.
 As a Cartesian-product space, it has a natural 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

product topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The basis of product topologies are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; these are just sequences of specific words, interspersed with wild-cards.
 Word-pairs are just specific cylinder sets: two words, with zero or more
 wild-cards between them, and an arbitrary number of wild-cards before and
 after them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Density of states, theoretical definition.
 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be identified with a cylinder set in the product topology.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a state can be identified with the log of the probability of that state
 (equivalently, the log of the measure of the cylinder set).
 The density of states is then simply the distribution of the states, as
 a function of their energy.
 That is, for a given small but fixed interval of energy, how many states
 are there in that interval? This is the density of states.
 In thermodynamics and chemistry, this is a fundamental concept; for natural
 language, it is novel, but worth asking about to see if any analogies hold.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, in chemistry, there are lots of low-energy states at low temperatur
es; it is hard to have many high-energy states at low temperatures.
 Typical distributions are the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for an ideal
 gas; the Fermi-Dirac distribution for fermions, and the Bose-Einstein distribut
ion for supercooled quantum states.
 The first is conventionally taught in college chemistry.
 Is there anything analogous in natural language?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Density of states, experimental result.
 Consider the collection of all observed word-pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w_{j},w_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The frequency with which some word-pair is observed is 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{j},w_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the energy is 
\begin_inset Formula $E=-\log_{2}p$
\end_inset

.
 The density of states 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(E\right)$
\end_inset

 is then just a histogram: how many word-pairs were observed in a small,
 finite-sized interval of energy? Making this histogram, one easily finds
 that, to first order, its a nice straight line (on a semi-log graph), so
 that the density of states is 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(E\right)\sim2^{-E}$
\end_inset

 over a wide range, dropping off at the low and the high end due to under-sampli
ng effects.
 This is, more or less, with some twists, a rephrasing of the old and well-known
 result that the Zipfian distribution applies to word-pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Zipf graph goes very nearly as 1/rank i.e.
 as the classical Zipf with exponent 1.
 However, it has a bit of a hump, as does 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(E\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Looking more closely, at the top-1200 ranked pairs, the Zipf exponent is
 3/4 (almost exactly) and not 1.
 This is a so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small-world
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 exponent.
 The open-world exponent of 1 kicks in above 1200.
 This suggests that all word-pairs above 1200 are under-sampled.
 This is out of a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{7}$
\end_inset

distinct word-pairs that were observed.
 The small world is indeed small, the provinces vast.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(E\right)$
\end_inset

 has a similar hump.
 The constant slope can be removed by rescaling to 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{E}\rho\left(E\right)$
\end_inset

 which revels the precise form of the hump: it is exactly a (log-normal)
 Gaussian! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Closer examination reveals that the idea of a measure on a product topology
 is naive and incorrect.
 The first problem is that the size of the vocabulary is not fixed; the
 larger the corpus, the more new words are found (proper names, geographical
 place-names, slang, marketing terms, technical terms...) In the limit of infinite
 vocabulary, this would imply that the measure is log-divergent, i.e.
 is not a measure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A better theoretical foundation is needed.
 (None is proposed here) Such a foundation would need to explain and characteriz
e:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The under-sampling effect, and the location of the large-world to small-world
 cross-over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The effect of human-scale finite sentence lengths on punctuation and determiners.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The under-sampling effect is foundational, and affects the graphed distributions
 in all graphs in all chapters of this diary.
 It's pervasive, and confounding, and makes it difficult to understand 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what's actually happening
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A preliminary sketch is made for how to untangle sample-size effects is
 given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Earlier chapters explored marginal probabilities, fractional entropies,
 mutual information, marginal MI and so on.
 These are re-examined again here, this time as functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vertex-degree graphs are presented.
 Vertex-degree graphs are commonplace in network analysis; it seems fitting
 to do that here.
 A vertex is a word, and it's degree is the number of (distinct, unique)
 word-pairs it occurs in.
 For the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\apprle D\apprle1200$
\end_inset

, the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(D\right)$
\end_inset

 of observing a word-vertex with degree 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 goes as 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(D\right)\sim D^{-1.6}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a small-world scaling exponent; it is far away from being a scale-free
 network exponent.
 Note that this is a statement about infrequent words; common words, like
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will have a degree in the millions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The word-pair MI distribution is composed of two parts.
 One part is a Gaussian, centered more or less on an MI of zero.
 This Gaussian is purely due to selections of word-pairs having no syntactic
 relationships, and contains no syntactic information.
 Subtracting this leaves behind the word-pairs with the actual syntactic
 information.
 That distribution seems to be log-normal, i.e has strictly-positive MI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Distributions of the word-disjunct MI are presented.
 They vaguely resemble the word-pair MI graphs, but are dirtier/uglier.
 No particular insight is gained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The ranked-MI looks vaguely like a Laplacian.
 Two ideas are developed: a fibered-Laplacian, and a Hamming-Laplacian.
 Experimental data is shown for the Hamming-Laplacian.
 It's curious, but provides no particular insight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's it.
 Now on with the main text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Field Theory Models and Statistical Mechanics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Field theory models applied to statistics and language have surely been
 thrashed to death in the literature (of which I am only dimly aware; thus,
 no bibliography.).
 The below is an attempted recap of some basic ideas, recast into the notation
 used locally in this diary.
 After a few basic initial definitions, it rapidly devolves into a presentation
 of experimental results (for word-pairs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Density of States
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting point is a discrete linear lattice of words in a sentence.
 Associated to each sentence is a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{1},\cdots,w_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 for words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

 and a sentence of length 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 We do not know that probability; we just assume it exists 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
.
 We can make experimental pair-wise observations of word-pairs as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(*,*,\cdots,*,w_{i},*,\cdots,*,w_{j},*,\cdots,*\right)$
\end_inset

 of pairs of words 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 within the full sentence.
 Note the former is a cylinder set, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 an element of the product topology on strings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\left(w_{1},\cdots,w_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 be a string (the sentence).
 Define the energy of a string as 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\sigma\right)=-\log_{2}p\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 and define the energy density as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\rho\left(E\right)= & \sum_{\sigma}\delta\left(E-E\left(\sigma\right)\right)\\
=C & \sum_{w_{i},w_{j}}\delta\left(E+\log_{2}p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac delta function (in principle) or just a finite‚Äìwidth, but
 thin Gaussian in practice, or, more plainly, just a box filter, so that
 we can do histogram counting.
 The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 appears because the sum over pairs is a multiple of the sum over all states;
 it over-counts (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\sigma}=\sum_{w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}}$
\end_inset

 counts all words at all word-positions.) A formal derivation of the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 from first principles seems tedious and unenlightening.
 Not to worry, we can force it experimentally simply by requiring that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\rho\left(E\right)dE=1
\]

\end_inset

I honestly do not recall if any of the prior diary entries ever supplied
 a graph of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(E\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Better late than never?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Interpretation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above definition of the density of states is motivated by the Boltzmann
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p=e^{-\beta E}$
\end_inset

.
 Taking the log of both sides and setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $E=-\log p$
\end_inset

.

The graph below uses 200 bins, running between a lower bound of 7.0 and upper
 bound of 30.0.
 Thus, the width of each bin is 
\begin_inset Formula $dh=23/200$
\end_inset

.
 The data is as marked, and, to provide a sense of scale, the line 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{E-30}$
\end_inset

 is graphed.
 Note that there is a scattering of dots at the upper-right and lower left
 (zoom in to see them).
 Dots correspond to non-empty bins in the histogram, with empty neighbors.
 These dots have a special significance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This graph can be understood as a kind-of upside-down Zipfian distribution.
 The scatter of dots at the top-right are the pairs that were seen only
 a handful of times.
 The topmost, rightmost dot corresponds to the word-pairs that were observed
 only once, and thus have a very high 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 Specifically, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}=\log_{2}985483375\approx29.8763$
\end_inset

 for this point, as there was a grand total of 985 million pairs observed.
 The density here is a Dirac delta spike, since there were 9215082 distinct,
 unique word-pairs observed exactly once; thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(E_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 is normalized to 
\begin_inset Formula $985483375/9215082/dh$
\end_inset

.
 The next dots correspond to the number of distinct word-pairs that were
 observed only twice, then three times,
\emph on
 etc.

 until they run together into common bins in the histogram.
 The dots at the bottom-left correspond to word-pairs there are extremely
 common (typically involving the words

, punctuation.) These would be ranked first in a Zipfian distribution, thus
 the bottom-left of this graph corresponds to the top-left of a Zipf graph.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if the counts in the right-most bins are smeared, so that they
 are not delta functions, but smooth, then the right side of the graph would
 twist down sharply.
 It appears that it could be approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula $(30-E)2^{E-30}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Under-sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The humpback shape appears to be due to an under-sampling effect.
 This is exposed and explained in the next few sections.
 Due to a finite sample size, it appears that the only pairs that are sufficient
ly sampled are those up to a rank of about 1200.
 After that, pairs are under-sampled.
 The result of that under-sampling is a humpback shape, as seen above; the
 top of the hump is where the under-sampling begins.
 This suggests that the eyeballed fit is incorrect, and that the Rank distributi
on should be considered only up to 1200.
 This is shown below.

This time, the slope is different: it is 0.75, which is, umm, err, I guess
 its a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small world
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 slope.
 This is no longer the canonical Zipf slope of 1.0.
 This raises the question: how many of the graphs in the earlier parts of
 the diary are compromised, as being mixtures of under-sampling and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual effects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? This also raises the question: aren't all learning effects always driven
 by an under-sampling? That is, isn't one always doomed to under-sample?
 How can one know this, and how can one take this into account?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whence this magic number 1200?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Top-ten Word Pairs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the above discussion about under-sampling, it is hard to avoid noticing
 that the top-ten word-pairs appear to follow an eve flatter slope.
 What does this mean? Clearly, they are not under-sampled, and so the flatter
 slope needs to have some more sophisticated explanation.
 
\end_layout

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more sophisticated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 explanation might be this: this is a finite-sentence-length effect.
 That is, the nature of human understanding is that we have a limited attention
 span, and a limited short-term memory.
 Sentence lengths, and the use of punctuation must accommodate these limits.
 Thus, sentence starters and sentence enders, and commas, for phrase identificat
ion, should appear at a constant rate, rather than at a Zipfian rate.
 And that is indeed what the above seems to confirm.
 OK, so that's an interesting discovery, its new to me.

\begin_layout Standard
The above shows 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(E\right)\times2^{E-26}$
\end_inset

 and an eyeballed Gaussian.
 The relative factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{E-26}$
\end_inset

 removes the dominant slope.
 It's 
\begin_inset Formula $E-26$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $E-30$
\end_inset

 so that we can draw the Gaussian without any normalization.
 That is, the Gaussian is just 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G\left(\mu,\sigma\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}}\exp-\frac{\left(E-\mu\right)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

without any further normalization.
 It's drawn for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=18$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=6$
\end_inset

.
 There is no theoretical reason (that I am aware of) to expect a Gaussian
 here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Properly, we should be fitting to a log-normal distribution, since 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is necessarily positive-definite.
 However, this far from the origin, the log-normal and the normal distributions
 look almost identical.
 Whatever, its an OK fit to a bulging, noisy graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does it mean? I dunno.
 It means that we need a theoretical framework for handling the under-counting
 phenomenon above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Gaussian is probably (almost surely) related to the Gaussian appearing
 in the MI scores, below.
 But I do not know how to derive one from the other.
 (Too lazy to figure it out.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Physical Interpretation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the density graph suggests that the total energy
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int E\rho\left(E\right)dE
\]

\end_inset

is unbounded.
 Of course, it is finite for this particular dataset, but the trend suggests
 that if a trillion word-pairs were observed, then the high-end of the graph
 would be at 
\begin_inset Formula $E=40$
\end_inset

 instead of at 
\begin_inset Formula $E=30$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, this is not a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system of finite energy, in the conventional sense.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The root cause of this is that the vocabulary is unbounded.
 As more and more text is observed, more and more vocabulary words are encounter
ed, and there appears to be no upper limit (geographical place-names, foreign
 loan-words, given names, imaginative sales terms, children's nonsense words,
 portmanteaus, ...) As a result, the number of distinct word pairs also grows,
 in an unbounded fashion, as the number of observations increase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we take the size of the vocabulary to be countable infinity and denote
 it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

 the natural numbers.
 The space of all strings (sentences) of length 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is then the Cartesian product 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{N}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{N}^{n}
\]

\end_inset

It would be nice to be able to assign a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 to this space, but even this is problematic.
 Consider the cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(*,\cdots,*,w_{k},*,\cdots,*\right)$
\end_inset

 of a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

 at location 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in the middle of all sentences of length 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Denote the probability as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{j}\left(w_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For English, and for many languages, the probability of observing a word
 is mostly independent of it's location in the sentence, so drop the subscript
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and just write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(w_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 as the probability of observing a word (or just define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(w_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 as the average over 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.) This is the measure of the cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(*,\cdots,*,w_{k},*,\cdots,*\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this to be a proper probability, we expect that we should be able to
 write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\sum_{k}\mu\left(w_{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset

which is an eminently desirable property of any measure.
 But we are not so lucky: the distribution of words is Zipfian, with exponent
 1, and so this sum is logarithmically divergent.
 That is, the Zipfian distribution of individual words tells us that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu\left(w_{k}\right)\approx\frac{1}{k^{s}}
\]

\end_inset

for exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, and experimentally, it is well-known that for natural language, 
\begin_inset Formula $s\approx1$
\end_inset

 and is typically measured to be 1.01 to 1.05 for datasets with millions or
 billions of words.
 For the infinite vocabulary 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

, we are forced to take the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

 and thus end up with a topological space without a conventional measure
 on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only good news here is that it is only weakly divergent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except the above conceptualization is wrong.
 Based on the revised results, taking into account the limited sample size
 (as discussed above, and further below) we have to conclude that in the
 limit of large sample size, that 
\begin_inset Formula $s\approx0.75$
\end_inset

.
 In addition to this, sentences are not unbounded in length (German philosophers
 proving the rule) and so the actual normalization requirement is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\sum_{k<N}\mu\left(w_{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is an upper bound on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

realistic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentence lengths.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What all this points at is the lack of a theory that takes into account
 limited sample sizes, as well as taking into account human cognitive effects
 such as finite sentence lengths, driven by attention span and the limits
 of short-term memory.
 Developing such a theory appears to require considerable effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above density-of-states results for word-pairs indicates that the same
 applies for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This is the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

, we're just bouncing around in notation, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the formal measure on the Cartesian product space, for given cylinder
 sets, while 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the experimentally observed frequentist probability (the Bayesian probabilit
y with the trivial prior.)

Dataset Notes

\begin_layout Standard
This part is too big to fit in a footnote, so I put it here.
 At first, attempted to work with the Run-1 dataset `
\family sans
run-1-marg-tranche-1234.rdb
\family default
` which contains the marginals.
 This dataset is painfully large, taking too long to load.
 It was using 50 GB and swapping like mad after loading 29M of the total
 38M pairs.
 Ouch.
 Try again with `
\family sans
run-1-en_pairs-tranche-123.rdb
\family default
` which should not have any marginals, just the raw counts ...
 Hopefully, skipping the marginals takes less time to load (?).
 The dataset stats appear in Diary Part Two, at the very end.
\end_layout

Word-Pair Vertex Degree Distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vertex-degree graphs are commonplace in network analysis.
 Oddly enough, I never really characterized the word-pair sets using more
 conventional graph-theoretic concepts.
 Time to make amends.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The collection of word-pairs can be taken to define a set of edges, thus
 defining a graph.
 This is a directed graph, but I think this doesn't matter, so will mostly
 pretend it is undirected.
 The collection of vertexes will be taken as the left-element of each pair.
 The edges will be the pairs going from left to right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The (out-)degree of a vertex is just the number of edges leaving it.
 We work with out-degrees exclusively, except for a few spot-checks.
 Basically, the word-pair graph should be approximately symmetric, so there

 Under-sampled, infrequent word-pairs belong to a small world!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is an interesting sample-size effect, which prevents naive scaling
 of histogram bin-widths!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is no theory to guide one through the sample-size effect, and it is
 clearly pervasive, affecting pretty much every graph ever drawn, ever,
 in this diary.
 It's a foundational effect, that cannot be escaped.
 Its inherent in this kind of data.

\begin_layout Itemize
One can graph all sorts of quantities as functions of the vertex degree.
 Does not seem to reveal anything noteworthy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recap: A vertex is a word, and it's degree is the number of (distinct,
 unique) word-pairs it occurs in.
 For the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\apprle D\apprle1200$
\end_inset

, the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(D\right)$
\end_inset

 of observing a word-vertex with degree 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 goes as 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(D\right)\sim D^{-1.6}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a small-world scaling exponent; it is far away from being a scale-free
 network exponent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this is a direct measurement of the under-sampled parts of the
 graph.
 That is, a word that has a small degree is necessarily a word that is observed
 infrequently.
 It cannot be a word like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which will have a degree of approx 100K (for this dataset).
 It cannot be a preposition, as these will also have degrees of 50K or more.
 Even common verbs and nouns are expected to have a gigantic degree.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Vertex Degree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first conventional question is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is the vertex degree distribution?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This is shown below, a graph of the normalized frequency of a word, and
 it's out-degree.
 The degree ranges as high as 300K with significant counts up to 50K.
 The graph only shows degree up to 1200.
 There are 1200 bins in this graph, so each different degree gets it's own
 bin.

\begin_layout Standard
The eyeballed fit has 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{frequency}=\left(1.1/\mbox{degree}\right)^{1.6}$
\end_inset

 and so that exponent is well below typical scale-free networks.
 The raw counts are shown on the right y-axis,
\emph on
 i.e.

\emph default
 un-normalized.
 The point of drawing it this way is that we see on the right where the
 count drops to one (and to zero).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Something unexpected happens if we go deeper.
 There are gaps between words with high degrees, and it seems like it should
 be reasonable to bin them together.
 The graph below shows degree out to 50K, collected into 200 bins.
 Thus, each bin is 250 degrees wide.
 The slope is remarkably different:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think this is purely an sampling effect.
 In principle, the slope should not have changed.
 Here's a quick sketch.
 If the original distribution is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{n}=\left(\frac{a}{n}\right)^{\gamma}
\]

\end_inset

then a re-binning into constant-sized bins of size 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g_{m}= & \sum_{m\left(k-1\right)<n\le mk}f_{n}\\
= & \left(\frac{a}{k\left(m-1\right)+1}\right)^{\gamma}+\cdots+\left(\frac{a}{k\left(m-1\right)+k}\right)^{\gamma}\\
= & \left(\frac{a}{k\left(m-1\right)}\right)^{\gamma}\left[\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{1}{k\left(m-1\right)}\right)^{\gamma}}+\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{2}{k\left(m-1\right)}\right)^{\gamma}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{k}{k\left(m-1\right)}\right)^{\gamma}}\right]\\
\approx & \left(\frac{a}{k\left(m-1\right)}\right)^{\gamma}\left[k-\frac{\gamma}{k\left(m-1\right)}\left[1+2+\cdots+k\right]\right]\\
\approx & \left(\frac{a}{k\left(m-1\right)}\right)^{\gamma}k\left[1-\frac{\gamma}{2\left(m-1\right)}\right]\\
\approx & Cm^{-\gamma}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the approximations 
\begin_inset Formula $k\gg1,m\gg1$
\end_inset

 are made.
 That is, there is a change in the overall normalization, and the early
 part of the slope, for small 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is reduced, but the overall exponent is not affected.
 Yet this is given lie to by the figure above.
 So what goes wrong? It is an sampling effect.
 For large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, most of the 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{n}$
\end_inset

 are not as given above, but are zero.
 The fraction of the time that they are zero is determined by the sample
 size, and they are zero often enough that the overall slope is changed.
 The net effect of sample size could be computed.
 Just right now, it does not seem to be a worthwhile exercise.
 XXX TODO.
 Do this anyway.
 This should be done.
 This seems like a foundational part of the overall theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's repeat the calculation above with an explicit log scale.
 This gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g_{m}= & \sum_{m\le\log_{2}n<m+1}f_{n}\\
= & \sum_{2^{m}\le n<2^{m}}\left(\frac{a}{n}\right)^{\gamma}\\
= & a^{\gamma}\sum_{1\le j<2^{m}}\frac{1}{\left(2^{m}+j\right)^{\gamma}}\\
\approx & \frac{a^{\gamma}}{2^{m\gamma}}\cdot2^{m}\left(1-\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)\\
= & C2^{m\left(1-\gamma\right)}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus, since we saw 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\approx1.6$
\end_inset

 in the earliest figure, we expect a slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1\approx0.6$
\end_inset

 in the equivalent log figure.
 This is shown below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename p6-density/log2-degree.eps
	width 80col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That initial slope is valid up to 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx1200$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\log-\frac{1}{p\left(w,*\right)}\sum_{v}p\left(w,v\right)\log_{2}p\left(w,v\right)_{2}n\approx10$
\end_inset

, after which a sharper slope sets in due to the sample-size effect.
 This gives the figure an overall hump-back shape.

In short: attempting to bin-count the above leads to misleading confusion.
 Naively, bin-counting is about smoothing variation.
 But, as this table makes clear, such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

smoothing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is actually averaging in empties.
 It's not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There is a distinct oscillatory behavior at the center-left.
 It is perhaps some strange artifact, having to do with the fact that 24

 at 24, and later peaks are perhaps at multiples of 24.

Other weighting schemes

The following sequence of graphs use weighting schemes that are perhaps
 difficult to understand, but seem worth exploring.
 Their physical interpretation is challenging and the significance is unclear.
 Do it anyway, just to say we covered all the bases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all of these, the horizontal axis shows the edge degree of the word,
 without multiplicity, so, the number of unique word-pairs that a word participa
tes in.
 The y-axis, however, uses weighted counting, with different weights.
 That is, if a word has an edge degree of 42, then instead of counting it
 exactly once, it is counted with a weight (mass) 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ne1$
\end_inset

.
 Graphs are shown for 
\end_layout

The vertical axis totals the marginal probability for that word.
 That is, instead of adding 1 for each observed edge (the support), it adds
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,*\right)$
\end_inset

, the left-marginal probability, or 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(*,w\right)$
\end_inset

, the right marginal probability.
 So, for example, consider a vertex of degree 5.
 There might be 10K such vertexes in this dataset.
 However, each such vertex might be observed 30 or 50 times, and so (for
 left-marginal counts) we would see 300K or 500K on the y-axis here.

This graph has the same general shape as the earlier ones, but has a distinctly
 different slope: its 1.9 instead of 1.6.

\begin_layout Section*
Word-Pair MI Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've graphed the MI distribution many times before.
 Notably, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Word-Pair Distributions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 document details these.
 But since we're on a roll here, lets redo it with the same dataset as all
 the other graphs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The big new news for this section is that I think I finally understand the
 nature of this distribution.
 It is composed of two parts.
 One part is a Gaussian, centered more or less on an MI of zero.
 This Gaussian is purely due to selections of word-pairs that contain no
 syntactic information.
 Subtracting this leaves behind the word-pairs with the actual syntactic
 information.
 That distribution seems to be log-normal, i.e has strictly-positive MI.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution of word-pair MI is shown below.
 As before, this is for dataset 3, which contains 28 million pairs.
 The MI is sorted into 500 histogram bins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename p6-density/pair-fmi.eps
	width 80col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution is clearly not symmetric.
 The two sides appear to be bounded by straight lines, with slopes as in
 the legend.
 Pairs with the highest MI are observed very infrequently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the same data, but with a different fit: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename p6-density/pair-fmi-signal.eps
	width 80col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why this shape? Here's a guess.
 If word-pairs are chosen completely at random, and the number of sampled
 pairs is much smaller than the total possible pairs, then one obtains a
 Gaussian distribution.
 Such a distribution is centered on a small but positive MI, due to sample-size
 effects.
 For larger samples, the mean tends to zero.
 Thus, perhaps the left-hand-side of this figure is just a Gaussian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, we are not selecting word-pairs 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but we are sampling all possible word-pairs over a short region of text.
 These are sampled uniformly, by uniform selection of random MST trees.
 Many of the sampled word pairs will not be linguistically-related, but
 instead just accidentally near each other; they are near each-other for
 semantic reasons, not syntactic reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking this Gaussian to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

common-mode noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and subtracting it, leaves an excess of word pairs with positive MI, having
 a peak near 
\begin_inset Formula $MI\sim4$
\end_inset

.
 The straight-line slope on the right suggests that the excess can be described
 by a log-normal distribution.
 Again, an eye-balled, imprecise fit is shown.
 These two, summed together, model the observed distribution almost perfectly.
 Perhaps a formal expression for the common-mode noise is easily derived,
 given a fixed vocabulary size and number of samples.
 An attempt to get this is made further below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theories of why the remainder would be a log-normal distribution are unknown
 to the author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pairs with the highest MI are observed very infrequently.
 The highest observable MI value is directly related to the sample size:
 it is a bit below the log of the number of observations.
 Thus, the sharp drop on the right side is purely a sample-size effect.
 Trimming does not appreciably change the shape of this distribution, other
 than to eliminate the very highest MI values.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FWIW, note that the left-hand-side slope might be more linear than it is
 parabolic.
 In this case, the left-hand side might also be modelled with a log-normal
 distribution, this time, mirrored.
 In this case, the whole idea becomes a bit more of a mirage: we have two
 straight lines, and the interpolation between them is accomplished by combining
 a pair of offset and mirrored log-normals.
 This does not change the overall conclusion: the bulk of the low-MI pairs
 are due to random noise from sampling, while the high-MI pairs encode syntactic
 information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, when given any particular word pair, how can we know which
 group it belongs to? Is it syntactic, or not? The old rule of thumb was
 that pairs with MI=4 or greater were meaningful, and those below were junk.
 The graphs above validate this rule of thumb.
 Forcing a hard-cut at MI=4 removes most of the zero-mode Gaussian.
 But we've known for eons that MI=4 is somehow magical; now we finally have
 insight as to why.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Ranked-MI Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just for giggles, here's the ranked-MI distribution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall the ranked-MI is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{\mbox{ranked}}\left(w,v\right)=\log_{2}\frac{p\left(w,v\right)}{\sqrt{p\left(w,*\right)p\left(*,v\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

Superimposed on this graph is the distribution of the regular MI, multiplied
 by 1.5 to get the width correct, and shifted by 10 to the left, to get the
 zero correct.
 Apparently, ranked-MI does not alter the distribution.
 I wonder what it does, if it were used for MST/MPG parsing ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, hang on.
 the Ranked-MI is just 1/2 of the

 Yow!

\begin_layout Subsection*
Neutral MI Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attempted theoretical calculation of the MI distribution that would result
 if word pairs were chosen at completely at random.
 There are two distributions of interest.
 One uses a uniform distribution of the vocabulary words, the other a Zipfian
 distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XXX FIXME Everything below is incomplete, incorrect, wrong.
 I'm too lazy to figure out why.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Uniform distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume a vocabulary size of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 A random word-pair consists of two random, uniformly-weighted draws from
 this vocabulary.
 We take the order of the draws as being important; thus, any given word-pair
 has a chance of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N^{2}$
\end_inset

 of being drawn.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 pair draws, with 
\begin_inset Formula $N\ll M\ll N^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chance of a given pair being drawn once is 
\begin_inset Formula $CM/N^{2}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 a normalization constant to be determined.
 Basically, it can be drawn the first time, or the second time, or the third
 time ...
 etc.
 but never twice.
 The chance of it being drawn twice is 
\begin_inset Formula $CM\left(M-1\right)/2N^{4}$
\end_inset

 and so now we have the usual combinatorics.
 The chance of observing a word-pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b\right)$
\end_inset

 a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 times is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(K\vert a,b\right)=\frac{C}{N^{2K}}{M \choose K}
\]

\end_inset

Right(?) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Zipfian distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repeat the above, with a non-uniform distribution.
 Each word is distinguished by it's ordinal 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 so that we have words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le k\le N$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of drawing word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{k}\right)=Ak^{-\gamma}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\approx1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 a normalization constant, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $1=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p\left(w_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of drawing a pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)=p\left(w_{i}\right)p\left(w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 since the probabilities are completely independent of one-another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we have to iterate this experiment 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 times.
 The probability of drawing a given pair 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 times is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(K\vert j,k\right)=C\left(p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)\right)^{K}{M \choose K}
\]

\end_inset

Write 
\begin_inset Formula $x=p\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 for short, then the normalization is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)=C\sum_{K=0}^{M}x^{K}{M \choose K}=C\left(1+x\right)^{M}
\]

\end_inset

Right??? I'm confused.
 Now, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=Mx\ll1$
\end_inset

 we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)=C\left(1+Mp_{i}p_{j}+\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)\right)\approx C\left(1+Mp_{i}p_{j}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and so the marginal is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(w_{i},*\right)=\sum_{j}f\left(w_{i},w_{j}\right)\approx CN+CMp_{i}
\]

\end_inset

but 
\begin_inset Formula $N\gg Mp_{i}$
\end_inset

 by assumption, so 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(*,*\right)=1\approx CN^{2}$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(w_{i},*\right)=\frac{1}{N}
\]

\end_inset

which seems wrong, so I made a mistake above!?

\begin_layout Section*
Word-Disjunct MI Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This revisits earlier results on connector-set MI distributions; see page
 22 of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Connector Sets Distributions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This revisit will work with `
\family sans
r4-mpg-marg.rdb
\family default
` which appears on page 4 of Diary Part Three.
 Actually, this is just a copy of `
\family sans
run-1-en_mpg-tranche-123.rdb
\family default
` with marginals in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the older `
\family sans
r4-trim-*.rdb
\family default
` were 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trimmed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the self-consistency checks were crappier.
 So we re-do the final self-consistency checks, using the code in `
\family sans
scm/gram-class/cleanup.scm
\family default
` to get fully consistent results.
 The updated dimensions are in the table below.
 The files are `
\family sans
r4-trim-10-4-2-djmi.rdb
\family default
`, etc.
 but are shortened in the column labels.

Mutual Information vs.
 Laplacian
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discrete Laplacian on a 1-dimensional grid is a tri-diagonal matrix
 of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta x_{i}=2x_{i}-x_{i-1}-x_{i+1}
\]

\end_inset

The pair-wise mutual information 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI\left(u,v\right)=\log_{2}p\left(u,v\right)-\log_{2}p\left(u,*\right)-\log_{2}p\left(*,v\right)
\]

\end_inset

Inserting a factor of 1/2 gives the ranked-MI
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{\mbox{ranked}}\left(u,v\right)=\log_{2}\frac{p\left(u,v\right)}{\sqrt{p\left(u,*\right)p\left(*,v\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

The discrete Laplacian somehow feels 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

similar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the ranked-MI, but how? Can this be developed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
(Dead-end?) Ideas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some suggestive ideas that don't sem to quite get traction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $MI$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feels like
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 some kind of re-normalized propagator, where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}p\left(u,*\right)$
\end_inset

 feel like vacuum corrections; but how this could be is opaque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u,v\right)$
\end_inset

 feels like a point in a base-space, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u,*\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(*,v\right)$
\end_inset

 feel like two different fibers above the point in the base space.
 The summation is happening on the fibers.
 That is, we've defined 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(u,*\right)=\sum_{w}p\left(u,w\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that, first, we take the fiber sum, then the log, and then compare a
 point in base-space to it's two fiber-sums.
 That is, the ranked-MI 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 a kind of discrete Laplacian, but it's over a weird fibered space; its
 a comparison over fibers.
 The generalization of this would be a funky Hamming-fibered Laplacian,
 so that, for triples,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nabla\left(u,v,w\right)=\log_{2}p\left(u,v,w\right)-\frac{1}{3}\left[\log_{2}p\left(u,v,*\right)+\log_{2}p\left(u,*,w\right)+\log_{2}p\left(*,v,w\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

and so on.
 (For one-dimensional fibers).
 So, conceptually, MI and ranked-MI are a kind of difference equation; they
 are kind of like fibered Laplacians, but ...
 what can we do with this insight? What can be constructed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Hamming Laplacian
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the very high-dimensional difference equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\Delta E\left(u,v\right)=\log_{2}p\left(u,v\right)-\frac{1}{2\left(N-1\right)}\sum_{w\ne v}\log_{2}p\left(u,w\right)-\frac{1}{2\left(N-1\right)}\sum_{w\ne u}\log_{2}p\left(w,v\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the size of the vocabulary, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $N=\sum_{w}1$
\end_inset

.
 Using terminology from Chapter 6, this was being called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, via analogy to the Boltzmann distribution.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(u,v\right)=-\log_{2}p\left(u,v\right)
\]

\end_inset

and so the difference eqn is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta E\left(u,v\right)=E\left(u,v\right)-\frac{1}{2\left(N-1\right)}\left[\sum_{w\ne v}E\left(u,w\right)+\sum_{w\ne u}E\left(w,v\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This difference equation is rightfully called a discrete Laplacian on a
 high-dimensional space.
 That this is the correct name can be seen as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basically, we're fixing a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u,v\right)$
\end_inset

 in the high-dimensional space 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 and then we are differencing to all of it's nearest neighbors.
 This is confusing because we really should have started with single words.
 Consider the observation frequency of a single word 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

 and define 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(w\right)=-\log_{2}p\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Experimentally, we don't track these values (why not? they've never seemed
 useful.
 But perhaps we should revisit.) A single word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as a coordinate or direction in a high-dimensional space,
 so that that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w\right)\in N$
\end_inset

 is a location, a single point in that space.
 All the other words provide the other coordinates, so that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u\right)$
\end_inset

's are all of the nearest-neighbors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, the Laplacian really is clear and unambiguous: it is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta E\left(w\right)=E\left(w\right)-\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{u\ne w}E\left(u\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is the conventional 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional finite-difference Laplacian

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, where we've taken the liberty of dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 because it is so large.
 If this still feels odd: bear in mind that all points 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u\right)$
\end_inset

 are nearest neighbors of the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The space itself is a simplex: all 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 points are equidistant from all the others.
 This is just Hamming distance one for a string of symbols that is one symbol
 long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For word-pairs, fixing a word-pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u,v\right)$
\end_inset

 and then asking what all the Hamming distance-one pairs are, these are
 precisely 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \left(u,w\right):w\ne v\right\} \cup\left\{ \left(w,v\right):w\ne u\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 That is the set involved in the definition of the pair-Laplacian.
 Should we call this the Hamming-Laplacian? The generalization to N-grams
 is obvious; we don't need this generalization (yet; we'll need something
 like of for the disjuncts! As disjuncts are just skip-grams in disguise.)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, worth formalizing it.
 Given a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-gram 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\left(w_{1},\cdots,w_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

, define the set of all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-grams that are Hamming-distance zero or one from 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ s\right\} =\left(*,w_{2},\cdots,w_{k}\right)\cup\left(w_{1},*,w_{3},\cdots,w_{k}\right)\cup\left(w_{1},\cdots,*\right)
\]

\end_inset

The Hamming-Laplacian is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta E\left(\sigma\right)=E\left(\sigma\right)-\frac{1}{k\left(N-1\right)}\sum_{\tau\in\left\{ s\right\} ;\tau\ne\sigma}E\left(\tau\right)
\]

\end_inset

The denominator is simply the number of terms in the summation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that nothing specifically calls out for 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 in the above definition: the Hamming-Laplacian can be applied to any function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Also, note that this extends to the entire sigma-algebra.
 The Hamming distance provides a graph structure to the sigma algebra, indicatin
g which elements of the algebra are nearest-neighbors.
 I am not aware of any theoretical results on Hamming Laplacians on sigma
 algebras.
 Save one, an obvious one: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu=0$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is a measure on the sigma-algebra.
 Now that I see this, this is definitely a very interesting and curious
 thing to explore!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caution about notation.
 Note that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(u,*\right)=\sum_{w}E\left(u,w\right)=-\sum_{w}\log_{2}p\left(u,w\right)\ne-\log_{2}\sum_{w}p\left(u,w\right)=-\log_{2}p\left(u,*\right)
\]

\end_inset

Obviously, the log and the sum cannot be interchanged, but using the star
 notation for wild-card sums makes it tempting to do so.

 As usual, the line is bowed, but we don't know why.
 Just for grins, there is a second fit: some numerology: 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{\Delta}$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi\approx1.618$

 the golden mean.
 This probably doesn't mean anything, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does the data lead to this graph? Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N=18.58$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}N_{\mbox{pairs}}=24.75$
\end_inset

 and finally 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}T=29.88$
\end_inset

.
 The far-right hand side tells us that almost all word-pairs are observed
 once
\emph on
 i.e.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $E=-\log_{2}p=29.88$
\end_inset

 or maybe twice: 
\begin_inset Formula $E=29.88-1$
\end_inset

 or three times: 
\begin_inset Formula $E=29.88-\log_{2}3$
\end_inset

.
 At the same time, these words are observed with a far more frequent neighbor:
 
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mbox{the},X\right)$
\end_inset

 for some obscure word 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

(maybe a typo?), so that although the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mbox{the},X\right)$
\end_inset

 is observed only once, the marginal sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{w\ne X}E\left(\mbox{the},w\right)$
\end_inset

 is small.
 Much of this graph is effectively just a reproduction of the earlier 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(u,v\right)$
\end_inset

 graph, including the bow in the middle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fiber sums are ..
 curious.
 These are (with mild abuse of notation) 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(u,*\right)+E\left(*,v\right)$
\end_inset

 or, more precisely,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
SE\left(u,v\right)=-\frac{1}{2\left(N-1\right)}\left[\sum_{w\ne v}E\left(u,w\right)+\sum_{w\ne u}E\left(w,v\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

This is shown in the figure below.

That is, most of the differential corrections are small; the vast majority
 of them are less than one.
 So, indeed, we can safely conclude that the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E\left(u,v\right)$
\end_inset

 is indeed very nearly the same as that of 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(u,v\right)$
\end_inset

, as the fiber-sum corrections are small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This graph looks messy, until one notes that it is approximately self-similar:
 the right-most limb is repeated on the left, getting progressively smaller;
 the right-most limb recapitulates the entire graph.
 I think the cause for this involves words that are see only once, twice,
 three times.
 Due to the pair sampling, if a word is seen only once, it will still appear
 in many pairs: it will be paired with other nearby words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclusion: what have we learned? Nothing really.
 Interesting ideas, but they don't seem to offer insight that wasn't already
 there.
 Nor can I find any useful application for them.
 What further can be built from this?
