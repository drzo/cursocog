\begin_layout Abstract
The core idea of consciousness as a form of embodied cognition is popular
 and widespread.
 Yet an abstract mathematical description of how this might work, anchored
 to first principles in physics, is absent.
 A sensory system 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

perceives
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the world: but what is it that is perceived? It can't just be some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

message
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as that seems to require a data–definition format and some homunculus
 to define it.
 Perhaps sensation is movement of structural relationships across a barrier
 or boundary between the agent's finite and limited self/inside and the
 unbounded outside of the external world.
 This requires the barrier only to limit what gets across.
 What is the mathematical description of such a barrier? Perhaps the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an accretion of structure inside an agent.
 How can this accretion be formally described? Jellyfish seem to be aware
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; discussions of consciousness often presume such awareness.
 Is there an algebraic formulation for such (self-)awareness? Suppose such
 a formulation can be created; is there anything within it that has the
 form of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

qualia
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, or is it mechanical and dead inside?

Research Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computation requires the articulation of a system using algorithmic language.
 Algorithms require precise structural definitions.
 Structural definitions are generically algebraic.
 Foundations for algebra include set theory, category theory and topoi.
 Thus, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

computational perspective on consciousness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fundamentally requires (seems to require) a reductionist description of
 the structure of the exterior world, the barrier that separates it from
 the interior world, and how that interior interacts and moves through the
 external world.
 The interior itself may have hierarchical structure: the inside of a biological
 creature is not a uniform puree of pancake batter, but also contains substructu
res.
 It seems this recursive structuring continues 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all the way down
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, at least as far as biochemistry,

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the research is to articulate what it means for there to be
 an inside, an outside, and a permeable boundary between the two.
 Does this boundary resemble a domain wall in a ferromagnetic system (
\emph on
a la

 Ising model)? Just as petroleum does not flow through rock, until there
 are enough holes/fractures in the rock allowing it to flow, exhibiting
 a phase transition at a critical fracture–ratio, then perhaps intelligence
 is similar: absent, until there is a critical level of organization? Many
 systems in nature exhibit self–organized criticality, and recent neuroscience
 results provide some indication that human intelligence operates at the
 point of self–organized criticality, with long neurons modulating the avalanchi
ng behavior that is characteristic of self–organized systems.

\begin_layout Standard
One can imagine that it is easy to write a mathematical description of inside,
 outside and a barrier between them.
 It is hardly clear how to take such a system, and have it drive itself
 into a self–organized critical point, exhibiting any of the basic phenomena
 associated with intelligence.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My personal predilection is for a rather conventional laboratory experimental
 approach.
 Forward progress is achieved thorough a mixture of theoretical articulations
 and experimental realizations.
 Try to build a system that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Collect the data.
 Analyze the data.
 Try to understand 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what happened
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lab
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here is software.
 Software is commonly distinguished into imperative vs.
 functional programming styles.
 Off in a neglected corner is the descriptive or declarative style.
 The declarative style splits computation into two pieces: a description
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and a distinct component of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how it interacts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The description of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be understood as a description of structure, of network relationships,
 of graphical vertexes and edges (or dots and arrows, for category theory/topoi.)
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how it interacts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 portion is a dynamical system or driver that mutates structures and relationshi
ps over time.
 The driver is more–or–less structure agnostic; the driver rearranges the
 descriptive/declarative program through combinatoric forces, e.g.
 free energy principles, maximum entropy principles, and/or related non-equilibr
ium thermodynamical principles, including conventional ideas formulated
 
\emph on
a la
\emph default
 Gibbs and Boltzmann, Markov/Bayesian blankets, 
\emph on
etc.

\emph default
 That is, the driver is presumed to accord well with generally–accepted
 conventional concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accepting this split between declarative expressions of structure and drivers
 of dynamical change requires a framework 
\emph on
aka
\emph default
 language for declarations.
 The framework to be used is Atomese
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
See https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomese
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Note that there are two distinct versions of Atomese; one that is an evolution
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classical Atomese
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and another, developed from scratch, in Ben Goertzel's Hyperion system,
 which is sometimes called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Atomese 2.0
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For practical and technical reasons (including stability, debugability,
 scalability and performance), the original formulation of Atomese will
 be used.

\begin_layout Section*
Expected Outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An experimental approach generally precludes fireworks and stymies hyperbolic
 claims of grand achievements.
 There's a certain rhythmic daily grind involved in constructing, running
 and analyzing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the simplest sensori–motor systems is that of walking through a file–syst
em, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

observing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 what is there.
 This is a very different domain than the conventional 3D abstraction of
 Minecraft, virtual worlds or robotics.
 It is also distinct from the 2D pixelated ARC Prize ARC-AGI-2 challenge.
 Nor is it one–dimensional, in the way that streams of words/text are treated
 in LLM's and transformers.
 The hierarchical structure of a file system seems closer to the structure
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge in the abstract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

information in the abstract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and thus may provide a better experimental domain for how a knowledge–processi
ng system ingests, manipulates, excretes, reorganizes and retains structural
 relationships.
 (Atomese is itself hierarchical tree–structured.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expected object of study is a self–organized collection of structures
 that exhibit navigation and movement through its environment (for example,
 a file system), together with interaction with and mutation (manipulation)
 of the environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expected outcome is the formal (algebraic, mathematical, algorithmic)
 description of such a system and a characterization of its behavior in
 statistical and observational terms.
 This includes scaling behaviors, measures of turbulence, observation of
 avalanching behavior, movement, localization,

, and attempts to formulate it in functional code.

 This is a small project; there is no plan to create a plan, with project
 planning time–lines or Gantt charts.

Budget Justification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hardware compute resources have already been procured, and so hardware expenditu
res of less than $10K are expected.
 The nature of this research does not seem to require the use of, or interaction
 with LLMs, GPT, or any of the deep–learning neural net systems; thus a
 budget of zero for LLMs is anticipated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the contemplated theoretical models might run much faster if ported
 to GPU's.
 Perhaps the theory may indicate that the descriptive, declarative systems
 resemble TensorFlow.
 If so, then a contingency must be set aside for rental of cloud–compute
 resources.
 However, the need for this, and the nature of this need is entirely unclear.
 There's a shadow of a hint at the edges; how it comes into play remains
 unknown.
 The current work is a low–level exploration of theory, and has not reached
 the stage of being compute–hungry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The budget is primarily that of the salary for the lead researcher.

Team and collaborators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Team of one: myself: Linas Vepstas.
 The research above is sufficiently arcane, and the description of it is
 sufficiently obtuse that I have not been able to attract interested parties
 or collaborators.
 I seem to be operating in a corner of the noosphere that gets no visitors.
 So it goes.
