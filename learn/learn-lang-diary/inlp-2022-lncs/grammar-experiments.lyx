\begin_layout Abstract
The OpenCog Learning project explores novel techniques for the induction
 of symbolic structure from environmental sources.
 As a first application of these ideas, the automated learning of the grammatica
l structure of English is explored.
 This document provides a summary of results observed to date.
 The symbolic structure manifests itself as large, complex graphs tying
 together words and grammatical structure.
 The induction process provides probability distributions on the graphs.
 The primary task is to describe and understand the nature of those graphs.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the OpenCog Learning project is to induce structure from raw
 observational data.
 In the most direct sense, this would be visual or auditory data.
 In a more sophisticated sense, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

observational data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will already have been processed by other information extraction layers,
 as the goal of learning is to do so hierarchically, recursively: to deduce
 structure in structure inside of structure...
 If this can be made to work, then, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

starting in the middle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not a bad place to start.
 In the present case, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the middle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a corpus of English text, and the goal is to extract grammatical structure,
 including morphology, syntax and the lower reaches of semantics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general theory of how this can be done is sketched out in a companion
 article.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vepstas2022symbolic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 The overall process is as follows: first, one computes the mutual information
 (MI) between word-pairs occurring in the corpus.
 The MI assigns a numerical score to how often a pair of words occur near
 each-other.
 This can be used to generate a maximum spanning tree (MST) parse of the
 text, which captures the syntactic structure of the text.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 This parse tree can be disassembled into individual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jigsaw pieces
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which encode the syntactic structure of the parse.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sleator1991"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 Individual jigsaws encode the local syntactic environment of a given word,
 not unlike skip-grams.
 Collections of such jigsaws can be understood to be vectors: each word
 is endowed with a lexis of all of the syntactic contexts in which it was
 observed.
 But this is too fine-grained; one wishes to generalize from the particular
 to the general.
 The vectors can be used both to discover words that have similar syntactic
 contexts (based on the similarity of the local environments) and also to
 factor out different word-senses, since different syntactic contexts associate
 strongly with distinct word-senses.

This text reports on the algorithms developed to perform the above, and
 on the statistical properties of the resulting graphical networks.
 The report is summary, encompassing more than a decade of research and

, Parts One-Six, and the adjunct reports.
 Rather than peppering this text with self-citations, footnotes will be
 used to indicate which of these to examine.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 There are obvious directions in which both the theory and the experiment
 could be taken, but haven't been so far.
 In the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

downwards
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 direction lies morphology, needed for Indo-European languages, and segmentation
, needed for Chinese.
 Further down, the extraction of phonetic structure and general audio processing.
 Levering the same tool-set upwards, one can search for high-MI pairs across
 multiple paragraphs, both to resolve references and to detect entities.
 Syntactic relations can also be extracted between different sense streams,
 say, between words and blueprints/diagrams, or words and photographs, or
 other hi-tech sensory data.
 The author believes the basic algorithm is generic, and can be ratcheted
 upwards, to arbitrarily high reaches.
 Whether this proves to be true cannot be known without conducting actual
 experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this paper focuses on the narrow tasks defined above, in
 the order given.
 The computation of word-pairs results in a graph, whose vertexes are words,
 and whose edges are word-pairs.
 What are the statistical properties of this graph? MST parsing and the
 creating of jigsaw pieces results in a matrix of (word, connector-sequence)
 pairs.
 What are the statistical properties of this matrix? Words are vectors in
 this matrix; the similarity between words can be judged with assorted different
 vector measures; how do these behave, and how does clustering and word-sense
 disambiguation proceed, in practice?

Software Infrastructure

\begin_layout Standard
All results were obtained by using the software found in the GitHub repo
 for the OpenCog Learn project.

 as a foundational layer.
 The AtomSpace is an in-RAM graph database with powerful graph query capabilitie
s, tuned for performance.
 It has shims that allow data to be stored in conventional disk databases
 and to be distributed across the network.
 Most notable for the present task is the

\end_inset

 it allows arbitrary collections of subgraphs to be used as the basis elements
 of a vector space.
 If one has two such vector spaces, then pairs of elements form a matrix
 of rows and columns.
 Given a matrix, one may compute marginal and conditional probabilities.
 This is, of course, quite ordinary.
 What is new is that the AtomSpace allows extremely sparse matrices to be
 represented: say, 100K 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 100K entries, of which all but a few million are zero.
 Conventional software packages do not provide tools for sparse data.
 Furthermore, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

base data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the AtomSpace are graphs; the matrices themselves are but slices through
 the graphs.
 For example, during word-sense disambiguation, columns correspond to connector
 sequences; these are selected subgraphs taken from the total parse graph.

\begin_layout Section*
Pair Counting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obtaining a suitable corpus for the English language is not as simple as
 it seems: it is not enough to train on a dump of Wikipedia articles.
 Wikipedia is descriptive, having a paucity of verbs and a surfeit of proper
 nouns and technical terms.
 The verbs of everyday outdoor adventure: run, jump, catch, are missing.
 This was remedied by working with a corpus of young adult adventure literature
 taken from Project Gutenberg and publicly licensed fan fiction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Word-pair counting is done by generating random planar parse trees, and
 counting the connected pairs.
 This provides a uniform sampling over the space of all possible parse trees,
 eliminating edge effects from conventional finite-sized window sampling.
 Overall, though, the difference between this and window sampling are not
 obviously discernible.

Data sets

\begin_layout Standard
Five snapshots of an increasingly larger English-language corpus were taken.
 These are summarized below.

It is well-known that word-distributions are Zipfian, but what this means
 is not always appreciated.
 No mater the corpus size, half of the vocabulary is observed only once:
 unusual given names, obscure geographical place names, foreign language
 loan words...
 and stray markup.

\begin_layout Standard
In the table above, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

 are the height and width of the matrix (the number of unique words occurring
 on the left and right of observed word-pairs).
 They are almost the same, but not quite: periods and question marks never
 occur at the start of sentences; capitalized words rarely appear at the
 end.
 The sizes are given as logarithms, as this makes comparison to entropies
 more immediate.
 The total number of unique pairs is 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\mathrm{Tot}}$
\end_inset

 while the total number of observations of these pairs is 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\mathrm{Tot}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sparsity is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}D_{\mathrm{Tot}}/N_{L}\times N_{R}$
\end_inset

, and is expressed in bits.
 It indicates what fraction of all possible word-pairs are actually observed.
 Observe how the sparsity increased by two bits, as the dimensions of the
 matrix increased by two bits (a factor of four; nontrivial in terms of
 compute-time, corpus size and RAM usage.) Thus, rarity is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}D_{\mathrm{Tot}}/\sqrt{N_{L}\times N_{R}}$
\end_inset

, and is seen to be approximately constant, independent of dataset size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total entropy is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{\mathrm{Tot}}=\sum_{w,v}p\left(w,v\right)\log_{2}p\left(w,v\right)
\]

\end_inset

with the sum ranging over all word-pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,v\right)$
\end_inset

 and the frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,v\right)=N\left(w,v\right)/N\left(*,*\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w,v\right)$
\end_inset

 is the observation count of a pair, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(*,*\right)$
\end_inset

 is the total count over all word-pairs.
 The left entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{\mathrm{Left}}=\sum_{w}p\left(w,*\right)\log_{2}p\left(w,*\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,*\right)=\sum_{v}p\left(w,v\right)$
\end_inset

 is the left-marginal sum; likewise for the right entropy.
 The mutual information is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI=H_{\mathrm{Tot}}-H_{\mathrm{Left}}-H_{\mathrm{Right}}=\sum_{w,v}p\left(w,v\right)\log_{2}\frac{p\left(w,v\right)}{p\left(w,*\right)p\left(*,v\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notable trends are that the number of distinct pairs increases as the square-roo
t of the possible number of pairs.
 The total number of observations per pair is very nearly constant, increasing
 only slowly with the size of the dataset.
 Notable is that the MI really does appear to be constant, independent of
 the size of the dataset! The low value of the MI, one and a half bits,
 indicates the paucity of word-pairs.
 They convey some information, but not very much.
 On the other hand, the sparsity is quite high: of all possible word pairs
 that could have been observed, only minuscule fractions of a percent are
 actually observed.

Remarkably, the overall numbers appear to be language-independent; almost
 identical values are seen for Mandarin Chinese text.

 To perform this counting, each Hanzi is taken to be a

 This is not technically correct, as Chinese words may consist of one, two,
 three or more Hanzi.
 However, segmentation is a challenge, and so at this level, for pair-counting,
 issues of segmentation are ignored.
 Presumably, the discovery of Chinese words as set-phrases will occur later
 in the learning pipeline.

Sample-size Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution of word-pairs is conventionally Zipfian, with an exponent
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\approx1.0$
\end_inset

, and is not shown.
 The focus here is on sample-size effects.
 The graph below shows the observation count for vertex degrees, for dataset
 3 above.
 Consider each word to be a vertex, and each observed word-pair an edge.
 This forms a graph.
 The degree of a vertex is the number of edges attached to it.
 What is the distribution of degrees in the graph?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the distribution is Zipfian, with exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\approx1.6$
\end_inset

.
 There are two notable sample-size effects.
 At the left-hand side of this graph are words that participate in only
 a handful of word-pairs.
 This dataset has 142K words in it; the graph shows that more than 100K
 of them participate in ten or fewer word-pairs.
 The flattening on the left hand side indicates that these are wildly under-samp
led.
 What are these words? Sample inspection shows that many of these are junk:
 bad punctuation, badly-escaped quotes, typos, stray markup mixed in together
 with foreign-language words, obscure place-names and other rarities.
 It is reasonable, before proceeding to later stages of grammatical induction,
 to label these words as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

junk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and trim them away.
 The result is a dramatically smaller dataset.
 This is a good thing: it occupies less RAM and storage; later algorithmic
 processing runs faster.
 But does trimming damage information? Apparently not; trimming to remove
 more than half the words changes the sparsity not at all, lowers the entropy
 by five percent, and lowers the MI by about a percent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the right-hand side of the graph, a risk to histogramming is exposed.
 These are words that appear in thousands of distinct pairs.
 Yet, for any given, fixed degree, there are only a small handful of words
 having exactly that degree, and sometimes even zero words.
 The higher the degree, the more likely that there are zero words having
 that degree.
 This also is a kind-of under-sampling: when generating histograms of distributi
ons, the lack of data in this range will also affect slopes and with it
 the conclusions about the nature of the dataset.
 Words with the very highest degree are punctuation: the period, comma and
 dash, and the determiner

the

: these appear in pairs with more than 2/3rds of the other words in the

MI Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution of word-pair MI is shown below.
 This is for dataset 3, which contains 28 million pairs.
 The MI is sorted into 500 histogram bins.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution is clearly not symmetric.
 The two sides appear to be bounded by straight lines.
 The author is unaware of any theoretical explanation for this shape.
 However, the following guess is offered.
 If word-pairs are chosen completely at random, and the number of sampled
 pairs is much smaller than the total possible pairs, then one obtains a
 Gaussian distribution.
 Such a distribution is centered on a small but positive MI, due to sample-size
 effects.
 For larger samples, the mean tends to zero.
 Thus, perhaps the left-hand-side of this figure is just a Gaussian.
 An eyeballed, imprecise fit is shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking this to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

common-mode noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and subtracting it leaves an excess of word pairs with positive MI, having
 a peak near 
\begin_inset Formula $MI\sim4$
\end_inset

.
 The straight-line slope on the right suggests that the excess can be described
 by a log-normal distribution.
 Again, an eye-balled, imprecise fit is shown.
 These two, summed together, model the observed distribution almost perfectly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pairs with the highest MI are observed very infrequently.
 The highest observable MI value is directly related to the sample size:
 it is a bit below the log of the number of observations.
 Thus, the sharp drop on the right side is purely a sample-size effect.
 Trimming does not appreciably change the shape of this distribution, other
 than to eliminate the very highest MI values.
 This distribution is not language-specific; a nearly identical distribution
 is seen for Chinese Mandarin Hanzi pairs.

MST Parsing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Armed with word-pair data, one can proceed to perform Maximum Spanning Tree
 (MST) parsing, as described by Yuret.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 One considers all possible planar trees connecting all of the words in
 a sentence, and, out of all of these trees, the one with the greatest sum-total
 MI of the edges is selected.
 A variation is the Maximum Planar Graph (MPG), which takes the above tree,
 and adds edges for high-MI pairs, as long as edges don't cross and the
 MI is above a threshold.
 Experience with Link Grammar (LG) suggests that MPG parses offer a significant
 advantage over trees.
 There, cycles force grammatical agreement between nearby words, which introduce
s a rigidness, resulting in a greater rejection of bad parses.
 This result should carry over to the present case, and help constrain the
 learned grammar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an MST or MPG parse, each edge is cut in half, and the half-edge is
 labeled with the word it used to connect to.
 This results in a connector sequence for each word, some connectors connecting
 to the left, some to the right.
 Every connector sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, or disjunct for short, is paired with a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 to form a word-disjunct pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing one notices is that there are vastly more disjuncts than
 there are words: two orders of magnitude more! This is easily explained:
 each disjunct is a context for a word: it resembles a skip-gram in many
 ways.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vepstas2018skippy"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 Next, one notices that the vast majority of disjuncts are observed only
 once.
 This raises the question: what is signal and what is noise? This can be
 explored through trimming, by removing words, disjuncts and word-disjunct
 pairs whenever their observation counts fail to pass a minimal threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results are summarized in the table below.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The raw data is in Diary Part Six.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The column labels indicate the trimming thresholds; in the rightmost column,
 all words with an observation count of less than 10 were removed; all disjuncts
 with an observation count of less than 4, and all word-disjunct pairs with
 a count of less than 2.
 After this initial trimming, an additional consistency trim is performed,
 to guarantee that all remaining words can connect to some connector in
 some disjunct, and 
\emph on
vice versa

Notable in this data is that even modest trimming removes the vast majority
 of words and disjuncts in the dataset.
 The total entropy and sparsity is strongly dependent on the trim; the rarity
 is almost a constant.
 It will later become apparent that heavy trimming is perhaps not a good
 idea: there is a considerable amount of information held in the infrequently-ob
served disjuncts.
 Characterizing this precisely, understanding what it means remains an ongoing
 task.

\begin_layout Section*
Grammatically Similar Words
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The machinery above brings us to the first interesting grammatical application:
 determining what words are grammatically similar.
 Each row in the above matrix is a vector; it corresponds to a word with
 a collection of disjuncts associated with it.
 Each disjunct is a context for that word: it is very much like a skip-gram,
 familiar from corpus linguistics.
 Unlike conventional skip-grams, it is determined by MST/MPG parsing, rather
 than simple observation frequency.
 This should result in much higher quality data, although this hasn't been
 directly demonstrated, yet.
 The interpretation is also different than a conventional skip-gram: the
 context of the word is re-interpreted as jigsaw connectors; and connectors
 must connect to form a valid parse of a sentence.
 This is very unlike conventional neural net approaches, where there is
 no explicit appearance of any grammar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How should similarity be compared? Conventional approaches employ the cosine
 distance.
 Experimentally, this appears to be the worst-possible way of determining
 similarity.

 Other possibilities include the Jaccard distance, and weighted variants
 thereof.
 One of these is optimal, in that it maximizes all possible similarities.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Moulton2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 Any of these do quite well.
 Keeping with the information-theoretic theme, using the mutual information
 between two vectors seems appropriate.
 This needs to be defined afresh, as it is not simply a restatement of that
 given above.
 Let the joint probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 of a word-disjunct pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 be as before: 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,d\right)=N\left(w,d\right)/N\left(*,*\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Define a vector inner product of two words 
\begin_inset Formula $w,v$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\left(w,v\right)=\sum_{d}p\left(w,d\right)p\left(v,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

The corresponding MI is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI\left(w,v\right)=\log_{2}\frac{i\left(w,v\right)i\left(*,*\right)}{i\left(w,*\right)i\left(v,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

Note that this MI is symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $MI\left(w,v\right)=MI\left(v,w\right)$
\end_inset

, which follows from the symmetry of the inner product.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How well does this work? Fantastically well; creating a list of the top-100
 most similar words, as ranked by MI, provides excellent results, excellent
 in the sense that just looking at the list it is clear that they really
 are synonyms, or are obviously grammatically similar.
 But then a problem becomes evident: all of the high-MI word pairs involve
 rare, infrequent words.
 If one is to build a syntactical lexis, one really wants to begin by looking
 at common, frequent words.
 A weighting that brings frequent words to the forefront is desirable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a weighting is given by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

variation of information
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The variation of information is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
VI\left(w,v\right)=\log_{2}\frac{i\left(w,v\right)}{\sqrt{i\left(w,*\right)i\left(v,*\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

There are also other possibilities, which look even more promising; the
 above, however, is the cheapest and easiest to compute.

The clusters above are sets of words, all of which have a high pairwise-VI
 amongst one-another.
 Most of these are obvious.
 The cluster of capitalized words is perhaps surprising: but these are all
 sentence-starters: they are similar because they all start occur first,
 and start similar sentences.
 (Recall, the corpus is adventure literature, with a lot of dialog in it.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get adequate word-sense disambiguation (WSD), one must be more sophisticated
 in clustering.
 A cluster should include only those disjuncts which are shared by the majority,
 excluding those that are not.
 An example of this is the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which can be the past tense of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to see
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or a cutting implement.
 In forming a cluster with other viewing (or listening) verbs, one wishes
 to accept only the disjuncts pertinent to viewing/listening.
 Excluding the others leaves behind the disjuncts for cutting tools.
 Thus WSD is accomplished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be accomplished with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Starting with the pair of words having the highest possible VI, one searches
 for additional words having a high VI to these two.
 These form the candidate members to the club.
 Candidates are accepted if they pass a threshold.
 It is useful to have a reasonably large club, which can be expanded by
 gradually lowering the threshold.
 As it is lowered, the candidate list increases, until suddenly it explodes.
 The exclusive club is no longer exclusive, but is inviting everyone to
 join.
 The graph below shows the size of the candidate list, as the barrier to
 entry is lowered.
 The listed word pairs are the initial seed-words for forming a cluster.

On the left, all of the seed-pairs are made of very frequent words.
 Does this pattern continue to hold for infrequent words? It appears to,
 as the graph on the right shows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above only provides a list of candidate members.
 Setting a high threshold keeps the candidate list small.
 But which words, exactly, should be admitted to the club? This can be determine
d by seeing what disjuncts the words share in common.
 For a given candidate list, one simply counts the fraction of all disjuncts
 that the words have in common (think of these as common interests in a
 social club).
 Next, consider ejecting one of the candidates; does the fraction of shared
 disjuncts increase, or not? If it increases, then the ejected candidate
 should be thrown out of the club.
 If it decreases, then that candidate should be kept in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In forming the group, only those disjuncts that the group members have in
 common are kept as part of the group; the other, non-shared disjuncts presumabl
y belong to other word-senses.
 This algorithm performs word-sense disambiguation.
 If one includes disjuncts shared by a majority, then this algorithm also
 performs generalization: it moves from particulars to generalities.
 Some words may have been seen in some contexts; others in different, but
 generally similar contexts.
 In admitting these disjuncts into the common group, all of the group members
 gain the ability to engage in these contexts, thus generalizing.
 The majority need not be a strict 50% majority; it can be a plurality,
 set at any threshold.
 This can be understood as the Jaccard index for the group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, high MI (or high VI) just indicates general similarity between
 words.
 The actual list of shared disjuncts is computed with a Jaccard index.
 It is this set of shared disjuncts that determine the grammatical behavior
 of the group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A collection of research results were described.
 Research is ongoing.
 An immediate next step is to evaluate the quality of the resulting grammars.
 The most important next step is to climb up the hierarchy: to repeat the
 process, but now looking at multi-sentence, paragraph, and corpus-wide
 correlations, with the intent of identifying entities and their properties.
 Equally important, yet equally daunting, is to apply these techniques to
 vision, sound or other kinds of information streams.
 The primary limitation to further research is the development of the tools,
 the software and infrastructure needed to carry out these experiments.
 Based on the current results, the future looks extremely promising.
