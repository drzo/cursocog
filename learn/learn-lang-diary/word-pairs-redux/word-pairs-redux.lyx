\begin_layout Title
Word Pair Distributions

\begin_layout Abstract
The distribution of the the mutual information (MI) for word-pairs is examined
 for English and Chinese.
 Understanding this distribution is important, as the MI is an important
 ingredient for the unsupervised learning of grammatical structure.
 The distribution is found to be bi-modal, decomposing into a zero-mode
 that appears to describe completely random pairings of words, and a true
 mode, that captures actual collocations (idioms, institutional phrases,
 
\emph on
etc.
\emph default
) This bimodal structure is found both in English and in Chinese, and is
 not only the same qualitatively, but is also quantitatively quite similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This report is an adjunct to, and an extract from the Language-Learning
 Diary, focused on describing recent (2015 and later) word-pair datasets.
 It is meant to provide context for a broader scope of work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current conception of the language-learning pipeline
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Goertzel2014,Vepstas2014learn"

\end_inset

 attempts to extract grammatical structure from text corpora by overlaying
 a rough, preliminary connectivity network on the text.
 That preliminary network can then be chopped up into small pieces, and
 those pieces can then be compared, using statistical techniques, to refine
 it's accuracy, and to build a lexical description of the network.
 The lexical description then captures the structure of the preliminary
 network, which is presumably some combination of co-locational, syntactic,
 semantic and predicate-argument structure, the details of which depending
 on what structure is highlighted in the preliminary network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a general mathematical setting, the statistical properties of a network
 are captured by the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

partition function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, an abstract mathematical structure that is given by the functional integral
 over all possible network configurations, each configuration weighted by
 a Boltzmann distribution, assigning a specific probability to that configuratio
n.
 Given that partition function, many network properties can be obtained,
 including approximate lexical descriptions of the network (as perturbation
 theory expansions).
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In machine learning and biological settings, the mechanism of a partition
 function with a Boltzmann distribution is commonly given the name of a
 Maximum Entropy Model.
 This simply refers to the idea that the states of the system are equiprobable
 (after weighting) and that equiprobable distributions maximize the entropy.
 This holds as a fundamental theorem, and can be used to define the entropy,
 or, equivalently, the notion of equiprobability.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Unfortunately, the partition function is unwieldy, verging on impossible
 to compute with numerically, and so a wide variety of approximations to
 it are commonly used, ranging from Ising models to neural networks.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One particularly common and important task is finding a decompositional,
 lexical description of the network.
 In physics, such a decomposition is given in terms of a perturbation theory
 derived from a Hamiltonian, and the associated Green's functions (propagators)
 obtained therefrom.
 In linguistics, such a decomposition is commonly given as a dependency
 grammar of a natural language.
 It is useful to recognize that these two descriptions are effectively equivalen
t; both seek to describe the network structure in terms of local interactions
 with not-too-distant neighbors, using a tensor algebra to capture connectivity
 information.
 Toggling between these two descriptions, one of which assigns weights and
 probabilities, the other of which invokes the algebraic structure of grammar,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lambek61,Marcus1967"

\end_inset

 can provide considerable insight into the problem of the machine understanding
 of natural language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The leading order structure of a network can often be described in terms
 of the pair-wise interaction of network elements.
 This is a foundational assumption of perturbation theory.
 Conversely, simple pair-wise interactions can lead to rich and complex
 network behaviors; this is the primary lesson taught by the Ising models.
 Despite their structural simplicity, Ising models still pose a tremendous
 computational barrier in all but the simplest cases.
 One common simplifying assumption is to approximate the interactions between
 pairs of elements in the system by the mutual information (MI) in that
 network.
 The MI approximation is sometimes a reasonable approximation to the Ising
 model, and sometimes less so.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mora2010"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Natural language clearly does not have simplicity of the Ising model; however,
 one can still pursue an MI approximation thereof.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"

\end_inset

 In this approximation, one samples a large corpus of text, and computes
 word-pair MI.
 These can be used as the weights of links of an overlay network.
 In particular, if one discards all links with the lowest MI, one is left
 with a spanning tree connecting all of the nodes in the network.
 This is referred to as the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or the Maximum Spanning
 Tree, depending on whether one is maximizing the MI of all of the links,
 or minimizing minus the MI.
 Such trees have been applied in a wide variety of settings, from immunoglobulin
 interactions in zebrafish
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 to natural language.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998,Nivre2006"

\end_inset

 No claim is made here that MST models are the 
\emph on
sine qua non
\emph default
 of unsupervised natural language learning.
 Rather, they provide a particularly simple and easy preliminary guide to
 the underlying network structure.
 This guide is meant to be refined to obtain the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 syntactic, referential (endophora and diectic), and general semantic structure
 of text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that such MST models depend on the the mutual information between
 word-pairs, it is important to gain some reasonable understanding of the
 structure and distribution of word-pairs arising in natural language.
 This is performed in the current report, for several datasets obtained
 from English and Chinese corpora.
 This report is structured as a diary entry from an ongoing research project,
 and thus, subsequent sections will document to a large variety of different
 datasets, how they were constructed, and their status.
 This documentation is mostly irrelevant to the primary findings of this
 report; rather, it is a formal record of the progress of ongoing research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report does describe multiple important findings and observations.
 These include the discovery that the distribution of the MI of word-pairs
 is bi-modal, with one mode, the zero-mode, appearing to correspond with
 essentially random pairings of words, and another mode capturing the true
 colocational quality of natural language.
 These two different modes can be seen to manifest in several different
 ways, in multiple different statistical quantities, and thus can be fairly
 easily identified.
 From this easy identification follows the idea that the two modes can be
 separated or cut-apart, with the zero-mode discarded, as it appears to
 be just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the data.
 Several different cuts are explored, to see what they do to the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hypothesis is then advanced: after discarding the zero model, the overlay
 network provided by the minimum spanning tree will be more accurate, or
 at least, more representative of the syntactic structure of natural language.
 This hypothesis is not tested here; it is the subject of ongoing research.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To facilitate that research, the idea of a Maximum Planar Graph (MPG) is
 introduced.
 The MPG is constructed by starting the MST tree, and then adding additional
 edges, for progressively lower MI, until a complete, maximal planar graph
 is obtained.
 The utility of the MPG parse is that the grammar obtained from it can be
 filtered after the fact: whenever a root word attaches to a connector with
 a low MI, that connector can be discarded.
 This can result in a huge savings of compute time and dataset management
 effort: rather than recomputing MST parses over and over again, with different
 data cuts applied, a single MPG parse can be computed once, with data cuts
 applied at later stages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it is pointed out that relatively little is known (by this author,
 at least) about the distribution of MI in random Zipfian (scale-free) networks.
 An earlier 2009 paper
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vepstas2009"

\end_inset

 had begun an exploration of the distribution of MI in random networks,
 comparing it to the distribution of MI found in natural language texts.
 It provides some initial guidance for how to tell apart 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 natural language from a random network; unfortunately, it leaves too many
 questions open.
 Carefully characterizing random networks, and how they differ from natural
 language networks remains an open, important task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general organizational structure of this report is chronological.
 Again: it is primarily a diary of research results, with a fair amount
 of interpretation and description added, so that it can be read by a wider
 audience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Definition of Mutual Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mutual information of word pairs has a non-obvious form.
 This is because a pair is already structured: one word necessarily precedes
 the other.
 Thus, one must use a definition that acknowledges that structure.
 For a word pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w_{l},w_{r}\right)$
\end_inset

 consisting of a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 on the left, and a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

 on the right, the MI is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI\left(w_{l},w_{r}\right)=\log_{2}\frac{N\left(w_{l},w_{r}\right)N\left(*,*\right)}{N\left(w_{l},*\right)N\left(*,w_{r}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w_{l},w_{r}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the observation count: the number of times that particular word pair
 was observed in text.
 The other quantities are wild-card sums: 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w_{l},*\right)=\sum_{w_{r}}N\left(w_{l},w_{r}\right)$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 The correctness of this definition, and it's precise interpretation and
 meaning is not given here; the reader is encouraged to consult other texts
 for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Word pairs can be observed in several different ways.In what follows, two
 of these ways are referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clique counting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random planar tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clique counting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method considers a window of some fixed size, and then counts all possible
 word-pairings within that window.
 The random planar tree method constructs a random planar tree connecting
 all of the words in a given sentence, and then counts only those pairs
 appearing in that tree.
 It is expected that these two methods give similar results, however this
 has not been characterized, and the true differences between these methods
 remains unknown.
 Almost all of the following results are obtained with the random-planar-tree
 method.

\begin_layout Section*
Distribution of Mutual Information – 31 May 2015
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A preliminary look at the distribution of mutual information in large English
 language datasets was performed by Rohit Shinde, Google Summer-of-Code
 student, in 2015.
 These results are recorded in this section.

 These were obtained by generating random planar graphs for English-language

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

balanced English-language corpus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Wikipedia articles have several deficiencies: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A near-complete absence of action verbs (run, jump, hit, ...) and a vast surplus
 of ontological descriptions (was, is, has, ...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An unusually high proportion of proper nouns (geographical place names,
 commercial product names, names of famous persons, ...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For these reasons, this dataset is perhaps less than ideal for studying
 the English language, although in most ways it should still be generally
 representative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 frequency rank for single words.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frequency is the number of times the word was observed.
 Eyeballing this, it appears to be a classic Zipfian distribution.
 The log is the natural log.
 There's something not entirely right with this graph/dataset: given that
 number of words is 396255 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\left(396255\right)=12.89$
\end_inset

, the x-axis of the graph should have extended a bit farther.
 The reason for the premature drop-off is unknown.
 Perhaps the graph was generated early in the data-collection process, before
 the complete set of data had been assembled.
 It does seem to be exactly Zipfian, with an exponent of what seems to be
 exactly 1.0, so this seems to be in good shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, the distribution for word-pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/frequency-vs-frequency-rank-wordpairs.png
	lyxscale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final dataset had 8880914 word-pairs, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\left(8880914\right)=16.00$
\end_inset

 and so again, this appears to be graphing only a preliminary, earlier version
 of the final dataset.
 Again, it has a Zipfian distribution, although now the exponent seems to
 be 0.7 and not 1.0 (just eye-balling it).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below is a scatter-plot of the mutual information of word-pairs vs.
 the rank.
 The distribution seems to be bi-modal: there seem to be two contributions.
 One is an isosceles triangle (or Gaussian?), centered on an MI=0; then
 another, second distribution, containing only lower-ranked word pairs,
 having an MI centered on 10 or so.
 This suggests an interesting hypothesis: the larger mode, centered at MI=0,
 captures an essentially random distribution of word-pairs in text.
 The second, smaller high-MI mode captures collocations: idioms, institutional
 phrases, set phrases, etc.
 The bi-modality suggests several ways of arranging data-cuts to separate
 these two modes.
 One cut would be to simply discard all word-pairs with an MI of about 5
 (again, just eye-balling this particular graph).
 A completely different cut would be to discard the 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{6}=403$
\end_inset

 top-ranked word-pairs.
 This cut doesn't separate the two modes, but does decapitate the zero-mode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core question is, of course, how do these two modes contribute to grammatica
l structure.
 That is, does the zero-mode contribute to grammar, or not? Is the zero
 mode 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just random noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or does it contain signal? Perhaps its the other way around: the collocations
 should be treated as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

single words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, whereas all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true grammar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is to be found in the zero mode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final graph shows the number of word pairs, as function of single-word
 rank.
 It appears Zipfian.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summary: the first two, and the last graph show a classic Zipfian distribution,
 which is exactly what is expected.
 The third graph appears to be bimodal, and suggests the presence of a mode
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true collocations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (high MI) and a dominant mode of random word-pair associations (centered
 on an MI of zero.) It is not clear if that bi-modality is actually present
 in the data, or is merely a trick of the eye.
 If it is present, it is not clear how these two modes contribute to grammar.
 The presence (or absence) of bi-modality, and it's effect on grammar seems
 to be an important question to pursue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Word-pair Asymmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section reports on the asymmetry of the distribution of word-pairs.
 Some words appear more often at the beginning of sentences (and thus, appear
 more often on the left-hand-side of a word-pair) while others appear more
 often at the end (the period ending a sentence, treated as a word, is dominant
 on the right-hand side of pairs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Left-right asymmetry - Definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $E(w_{1},w_{2})$
\end_inset

 as being the relation that both words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

 occur at the ends of an edge in the same sentence, but in arbitrary order.
 It is symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $E(w_{1},w_{2})=E(w_{2},w_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 words, define the observation count of a relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 between them as 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(R,w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Use the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to represent the ordered pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

; that is, the relation is 
\begin_inset Formula $A\left(w_{1},w_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By these definitions, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(E,w_{1},w_{2})=N(A,w_{1},w_{2})+N(A,w_{2},w_{1})
\]

\end_inset

This is the symmetrized count.
 It is useful to mod out one of the two words, and to consider the sum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(E,w)\equiv N(E,w,*)=\sum_{w_{2}}N(E,w,w_{2})
\]

\end_inset

This counts how often the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 occurs at one end or the other of a word-pair.
 It is a distinct count from 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w)$
\end_inset

, which, by definition, counts only once per word in a sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Left-right asymmetry - Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section explores how often a given word occurs on the left side of
 a word pair, 
\emph on
vs.

\emph default
 how often it occurs on the right.
 This, of course, depends on the word.
 If sentences and words were randomly generated, one would expect that a
 given word would occur on the left, or on the right, exactly half the time.
 That is, in a random world, one expects 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N(w,*)\approx N(*,w)
\]

\end_inset

This cannot hold for human languages: the exclamation point, question mark
 and period occur exclusively on the right hand-side of any randomly-generated
 pair.
 This is not limited to punctuation: for Japanese, sentences usually end
 in a verb, and thus, for Japanese verbs 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, one expects that 
\begin_inset Formula $N(v,*)\ll N(*,v)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some typical values for English words are given in the table below.
 Here, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $2N(w)\equiv N(*,w)+N(*,w)$
\end_inset

 is (twice) the number of times the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is observed in a pair relation.
 The word-pairs were generated by creating random planar parse trees of
 sentences in the corpus, and then counting a pair, if two words are connected
 by a parse link.

A histogram summarizing the above table is shown below.
 It bin-counts the asymmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,w)-N(w,*)/2N(w)$
\end_inset

.
 About 100 bins are used, from an observation of 8.88 million distinct English-la
nguage word pairs, where were observed for a total of 420 million times.
 These pairs connected about 400K distinct words.
 The number of distinct words is large, because these include surnames,
 and geographical names, as well as an assortment of foreign-language words
 as might be encountered in a sampling of English Wikipedia pages.

Note that the AtomSpace infrastructure does have some serious performance
 limitations: the AtomSpace is designed to be a very general-purpose hyper-graph
 manipulation and analysis tool, and not a fast statistics-collecting tool
 for narrow tasks.
 One could probably write custom word-pair-counting software that would
 run an order of magnitude faster than the AtomSpace.
 But doing so would just lose the flexibility over later, more complex analysis.

Word-pairs were obtained via 'clique counting': given a window size of 6,
 all-possible word-pairs were considered (a graph clique) and each such
 word-pair was counted once.
 The window is then shifted over by one word, and the process is repeated.
 This means that, on average, word-pairs in the middle of the sentence are
 counted six times.
 There were 9376710 (about 9M) unique 'clique pairs' observed

Some summary report of various different datasets holding word-pairs.
 All of the word-pair-counts were obtained by using the LG 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ANY
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parser, which generates random planar graphs (random planar parse trees).
 Many of these datasets refer to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

MST
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and that is because those datasets 
\emph on
also
\emph default
 contain disjuncts (Sections) from MST parses.
 This additional data has no effect on the word-pairs; it just makes the
 datasets fatter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The common procedure used during this era was to take a tranche of text,
 perform random planar-graph parsing, and count the resulting word-pairs.
 Next, marginal statistics and word-pair MI is computed.
 Then the same tranche of text was run through the MST parser, and so disjunct
 stats are added.
 Then the next, and the next tranche are processed (up to a total of five
 distinct tranches, described below.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were several problems encountered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Early datasets include as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 character sequences that contain infix punctuation, typically because the
 input text used hyphens, dashes, double-dashes and commas to delimit words,
 but did not put spaces before or after the punctuation.
 The tokenizer was to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stupid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to recognize these, and treated them as single words.
 Some of the datasets filter these out, after-the-fact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Same as above, with with sentence-ending periods.
 These can be recognized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that have an embedded period, followed by a capital letter.
 None of the datasets have these filtered out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The MST parser was (mildly) buggy; when a sentence contained multiple instances
 of the same word, the generated disjuncts were incorrect.
 See bug
\emph on
 
\family typewriter
\emph default
opencog/atomspace#2252
\family default
 for the fix.
 This does not affect word-pair data, but does produce low-quality disjuncts
 that contribute to the overall noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The inclusion of the MST data makes the datasets large and slow to load.

Size The dimensions of the array.
 This is the number of unique, distinct words observed occurring on the

 Hyphenated words remain, as do decimal numbers and abbreviations.
 Unfortunately, this means that there are some bogus words that remain -
 sentence boundaries were not detected when there was no space after a period,
 and before the start of the next sentence.
 These are characteristically words with a period in them, followed by a
 capital letter.
 These should have been filtered out, but weren't.

\begin_layout Description

\noun on
zh_pairs_sone
\noun default
 A parse of Mandarin Wikipedia, with each individual character (hanzi) treated
 as a single item (so that, during pair-counting, pairs are formed between
 items).
 Non-Chinese characters are grouped into words in the normal way, by splitting
 according to white-space (and punctuation).
 Thus, the total dimensions of the dataset are given by the number of observed
 Chinese characters (hanzi) plus the number of observed non-Chinese words
 (and punctuation).

Now, for some commentary, as to the summary stats.
 For English, as the number of pair observations increase, so do the number
 of unique, distinct words.
 The relation even seems to be linear: double the number of pair observations,
 and the number of different words also increases.
 This suggests something Zipfian at work.
 The explosion of words is hypothesized to be given names, although these
 datasets all fail to split hyphenated words, and so some may be due to
 that.
 The point is that the average observations per pair increases with difficulty,
 and the entropy and MI does not budge at all.

 datasets does provide some contrast: The 
\noun on
_sim
\noun default
 dataset, built from Wikipedia, is distinctly different from the Gutenberg
 datasets.
 Certainly, the prose style in the two datasets is quite different, with
 Wikipedia consisting of statements of facts (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the Gutenberg texts are primarily narrative adventures (

Comparing English to Chinese is very interesting.
 The Chinese

 dataset has three times, almost four times more observations per pair;
 equivalently about 3-4 fewer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is partly due to the fixed number of ideograms in the language.
 Remarkably, the entropy and MI are untouched.
 This suggests that the entropy and MI are capturing something about the
 human nature of language use, as opposed to something descriptive of the
 language itself.
 However, a lot more data would be needed to see if this is really true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, the

 behaves much more like English in it's statistics.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The columns are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Size The left and right dimensions, as before.
 Viz, the number of unique, distinctly different words observed on the left
 and the right side of a pair.
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the number of columns and rows in the matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Support The support is the average number of word-pairs that a word participates
 in (on the left, or on the right).
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the average number of non-zero entries in each
 row or column.
 Viewed as (row or column) vectors, this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

support
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a (row or column) vector.
 Mathematically, this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm of each vector: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(w_{L},*)\right|=\sum_{w_{R}}\left(0<N(w_{L},w_{R})\right)$
\end_inset

 and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|(*,w_{R})\right|=\sum_{w_{L}}\left(0<N(w_{L},w_{R})\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Count The count is the average number of observations that a word-pair was
 observed, for a given word.
 Viewed as a matrix, this is the average value of each non-zero entry (averaged
 over rows, or columns).
 Viewed as vectors, this is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{1}$
\end_inset

 norm divided by the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{1}$
\end_inset

 norm is just the wild-card counts 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N(*,w_{R})$
\end_inset

, where as always, the wild-card counts are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)=\sum_{w_{R}}N(w_{L},w_{R})$
\end_inset

.
 The count shown in the table is then the average count: 
\begin_inset Formula $N(w_{L},*)/\left|(w_{L},*)\right|$
\end_inset

 for the rows, and likewise for the columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Length The length is the average length of the row and column vectors.
 This is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{2}$
\end_inset

 norm divided by the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{0}$
\end_inset

 norm.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{2}$
\end_inset

 norm is just the standard concept of the length of a vector in Euclidean
 space.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $L(w_{L},*)=\sqrt{\sum_{w_{R}}N^{2}(w_{L},w_{R})}$
\end_inset

, and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $L(*,w_{R})=\sqrt{\sum_{w_{L}}N^{2}(w_{L},w_{R})}$
\end_inset

.
 The length is interesting, because it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

penalizes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 word-pairs with only a small number of counts.
 The act of squaring the count has the effect of giving much higher 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

confidence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to large observation counts: a word-pair observed twice as often is given
 four times the credit.
 The length shown in this table is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 length: it is 
\begin_inset Formula $L(w_{L},*)/\left|(w_{L},*)\right|$
\end_inset

 for the rows, and likewise for the columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's what is so interesting in this table: the support, for Chinese,
 is outrageously different than it is for English.
 For a given item (hanzi, for Chinese, word, for English), the Chinese hanzi
 participates in three to four fewer item-pairs! Since pairs are formed
 on a sentence-by-sentence basis, this means that the variety of different
 hanzi that can occur in a single sentence is much more constrained, much
 more strongly correlated.
 Now, perhaps this comparison is not quite valid: because we are not comparing
 words to words, but rather English words to Chinese 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

morphemes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (in the sense that Chinese words are typically composed of 1, 2 or 3 hanzi).
 Still, its interesting and surprising.
 This has knock-on effects: the observational counts are much higher, as
 are the average lengths.
 It would be interesting to repeat the previously given analysis of the
 various distributions, and see how they differ.

The Gaussian in the above figure is slightly offset to the right, centered
 on an MI=1 rather than MI=0.
 As noted in
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vepstas2009"

\end_inset

, such an offset to positive MI is characteristic of an 
\emph on
incomplete
\emph default
 sampling of random text.
 That is, if one had a vocabulary of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 words, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

 possible word-pairs, each of which one might expect to see equally often,
 in the long-run.
 However, if one samples randomly generated sentences, and these sentences
 contain less than about 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

 words amongst all of them, then some pairs will never be observed.
 The resulting MI distribution will be a Gaussian, but it will be centered
 on a positive value of MI.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should be compared to the distribution given below, for hanzi pairs.
 The effective hanzi vocabulary is much much smaller; about 
\begin_inset Formula $N=$
\end_inset

7K, as noted for 
\noun on

\noun default
.
 This vocabulary size allows for 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}=$
\end_inset

50M word-pairs to be observed, in principle, if they were randomly arranged;
 in practice 6M were observed.
 This is a much 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

deeper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sample of all possible word-pairs than the English corpora allow; the English
 vocabulary is orders of magnitude larger.

\begin_layout Standard
The experiments with randomly-generated corpora, given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vepstas2009"

\end_inset

 are interesting, but incomplete.
 They leave open multiple questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How does the MI distribution change when random planar tree parses are used
 to obtain word-pairs, as opposed to clique-counting?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How does the MI distribution change as a function of sample size (holding
 the vocabulary size fixed)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How does the MI distribution change as frequency of vocabulary words is
 altered from a uniform distribution to a Zipfian distribution?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last question is perhaps the most relevant: it implies that there is
 no finite-sized vocabulary; that all vocabularies are infinite.
 This is exactly what is seen, as more and more text is analyzed.
 A survey of the words in the 
\emph on
en_cfive
\emph default
 dataset shows more than a few (ancient) Greek words, written in the Greek
 alphabet.
 These are clearly 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not English
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but they did appear in some English text, somewhere in the collection
 of corpora.
 They are rare; they necessarily can participate in only a small number
 of word-pairs.
 Yet most of the words in the dataset are like this - if not Greek, then
 Latin or Spanish or German (I guess there are travelogues amongst the corpora),
 and plenty of given names, surnames, geographical place names and the like.
 Each is increasingly more rare than the last, but the grand-total bulk
 of them is quite large.
 How does this large bulk of infrequent, unlikely word-pairs affect the
 MI distribution? How does it manifest itself?

Chinese character pair dataset July 2017
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report provides a quick sketch of a dataset containing Mandarin Chinese
 character pairs.
 This differs from English in two important ways.
 First, obviously, its not English.
 Second, there was no word segmentation done: each character (hanzi, ideogram)
 is treated as being distinct, and so all pairs are between hanzi.
 The goal/hope here is that word segmentation will appear 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

naturally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as a by-product of high-MI hanzi pairs.
 The dataset is the

As mentioned before: the dimensions of the dataset are larger than the number
 of hanzi, because the dataset treats all Latin-alphabet words as single
 words.
 Since this dataset is generated from Wikipedia, we can expect that many
 of the entries correspond to English-language technical terms and named
 entities, such as product names, geographical place names and the names
 of people.
 There is also likely to be a mixture of simplified and traditional hanzi
 in the dataset.

Recall that a Gaussian distribution takes the form of a parabola, when graphed

 In this case, the parabola is centered exactly on zero, with an eye-balled

 This implies that the RMS variance

One impediment to properly understanding these numbers is that the distribution
 of each of them is approximately Zipfian.
 That is, when the rows (or columns) are treated as vectors, and are then
 ranked according to the size of the support, these follow a Zipfian distributio
n.
 This can be clearly seen in the figures below.
 The primary point of confusion is that the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is delicate ...
 one should say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

inappropriate

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{2}$
\end_inset

 vector norms, for the columns and rows of the pair-matrix (these norms
 are exactly as defined in an earlier table above).
 All of the graphs have a bit of a hump in the middle, with the hump being
 most prominent in the support distribution.
 The corresponding histograms are shown below.
 These are to be understood as follows.
 There are precisely 580804 columns, and thus that many column vectors.
 The log (base 2) of the support (respectively, count and length) of each
 vector is taken; the vector is then assigned to one of 200 bins, according
 to that log-value.
 The final tally of the number of vectors in each bin is shown in the graphs
 below.
 Properly, this can be labeled as a probability; simply by multiplying by
 the bin-width, and dividing by the total number of vectors.
 Thus, the total area under the curve is exactly 1.0.
 Do not be deceived by the spiky areas on the left: these are very full
 bins next to empty bins.
 With a bit of smoothing, these would get smoothed down; but no smoothing
 was applied (other than the natural smoothing of the finite bin-width.)

These histograms help 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the not-quite straight-line Zipfian dependence in the earlier graphs.
 A true Zipf distribution would not demonstrate peaks at a finite size.
 Consider, for example, the vector length distribution.
 Eyeballing the rightmost graph, it appears that there is a peak at about
 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{4}=16$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vectors have a length of about 16.
 There are many vectors longer than this, but not so many shorter than this.
 The correct interpretation for this is that most words have 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{4}=16$
\end_inset

 nearby neighbors, or more; very few words are so strongly tied into idioms
 or collocations that they have a paucity of neighbors, a paucity of context.
 This should be contrasted with vectors having very large support or length:
 these correspond to words that appear next to just about any other word.
 That is, for a fixed word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

, the support counts the number of distinct pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w_{l},w_{r}\right)$
\end_inset

; a large support means that there are many words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{l}$
\end_inset

 the appeared near 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

; a small support means that very few were.
 The count (the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{1}$
\end_inset

-norm) just counts how many such word-pair observations were made (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 with multiplicity).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might wonder if the ratio of count and length to support is Zipfian;
 it is; this is shown below.

Presumably, the prominent dip in the middle is due to the hump visible in
 the support distribution.

\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{2}$
\end_inset

 vector norms correlate with each other; that is, whether the ratio taken
 above was justified.
 It does seem to be, as the following graphs show.

\end_inset

 and of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{0}$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{2}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 To keep the graphs relatively small and not overly busy, only every 25th
 point is graphed (so only 581K/25= approx 23K points are actually shown).
 Keep in mind that the projection of these scatter-plots along the horizontal
 axis gives rise to the histograms presented earlier.
 The linear lower bound apparent in both figures is simply a statement that
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{2}$
\end_inset

 norms cannot be less than the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{0}$
\end_inset

-norm.
 That is, a given word-pair cannot be observed less than once.
 The large variation at low support is an alternative indication for a fair
 number of collocations in the data.
 When a column-vector (the vector for the fixed word 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{r}$
\end_inset

) has low support, that means that only a few distinct pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w_{l},w_{r}\right)$
\end_inset

 were seen.
 But if that same vector has a large length, that means that this handful
 of pairs was seen many, many times.
 These are collocations: words that appear near each other.
 Of course, one expects collocations in textual data.
 These graphs characterize just how many actually show up, when one does
 unbiased, random counting.

MI Distributions

More interesting than the vector norms is the MI distribution, as this has

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(MI\right)=0.11\exp\left(-0.1\left(MI-0.8\right)^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 which is very similar to the distributions given earlier.
 The RMS variation is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1=1/2\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\sqrt{5}\approx2.2$

\begin_inset Formula $N$

The Zipf distribution is drawn with the same slope as before; this is done
 to allow direct comparison.
 A Gaussian is drawn, but this time, the left edge appears more linear than
 parabolic.
 The Gaussian is, again, an eye-ball fit, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(MI\right)=0.2\exp\left(-0.18\left(MI-0.9\right)^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Again, this is an eyeball fit; the difference in the mean should be considered
 as an indicator of the uncertainty in the mean.
 The difference in the variance is quite real.
 This time, the distribution appears to be more obviously a sum of two distinct
 distributions.
 This is shown more clearly in the figure below.

 Again, the parameters are obtained by eyeballing; the curve is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0.08\times2^{-0.37MI}+0.17\exp\left(-0.18\left(MI-0.9\right)^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The Gaussian has the same shape as before; it's strength was reduced to
 better fit the data.
 Again, the left edge of the data appears more linear than parabolic; perhaps
 the correct fit would be some blending of of two semi-log-linear distributions.
 Without a robust theoretical foundation, its uncertain just how far these
 fits can be pushed.

This image, 400 pixels by 200 pixels, is a sequence of histograms.
 The image extends, left to right, from MI=-10 to MI=+30, that is, spanning
 exactly the same MI range as the earlier histograms, as well as having
 the same bin-width.
 The bottom-most horizontal line corresponds to (unique) word-pairs that
 were observed only once; the second-from-the-bottom horizontal line word-pairs
 that were observed twice, and so on by frequency.
 The vertical axis is logarithmic, so the lines soon run together, once
 the log-frequency is less than a pixel in size (with some aliasing effects
 at first).

 The first horizontal lines is at 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}8.016\times10^{-10}=30.21$

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The color coding, from black to red, indicates how many word-pairs were
 observed that can be assigned to a single pixel.
 The color scale is logarithmic, so that red-pixels have bin-counts that
 are orders of magnitude larger than blue pixels.
 The integral along a vertical line then yields a single bin-count for single
 MI-range, independent of the observation frequency.
 The counts are for unique word-pairs, and not word-pairs with multiplicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scatter-plot provides a bit more insight into the bimodal distribution.
 As noted before, many of the most-frequent word-pairs (pixels in the upper
 half of the image) are also the ones with the lowest MI (pixels to the
 left of the image).
 Indeed, the prominent peak is located at just above MI=0; the left-most
 vertical white line is positioned on MI=0; the one on the right is at MI=5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Cutting distributions - July 2019
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That there is a bimodal distribution seems clearly established, no matter
 how one looks at the data.
 It also seems clear that one of the modes, termed the zero-mode, corresponds
 to completely random word-pair choices.
 Since MST parses and the extracted disjuncts are based on the MI of individual
 word-pairs, it seems reasonable that their quality might be improved by
 cutting away those word-pairs corresponding to random noise, and keeping
 only those arising from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 word collocations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways in which such cuts might be made.
 One can trim away all word pairs having an MI below some threshold.
 One can trim away word pairs having support above some given threshold.
 Perhaps a cut combining length and support would be appropriate.
 Each different cut will generate a different word-pair dataset; each different
 dataset will result in different parses and disjuncts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variety of different cuts means that the parameter space needs to be
 explored.
 Cutting before parsing means that a lot of CPU time must be devoted to
 re-parsing the corpora to obtain disjuncts.
 Fortunately, there is a trick that can be used to reduce the amount of
 required computations: there is a way to apply the cuts after parsing,
 rather than before.
 The trick works as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than parsing to obtain a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST), one can parse
 to obtain a Maximum Planar Graph (MPG).
 The MPG parse starts with the MST parse, and then adds edges, one at a
 time, each having the highest MI of all the others, to obtain the largest
 possible planar graph.
 This planar graph can be cut, just as before, and used to obtain disjuncts.
 The resulting disjuncts are necessarily 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bushier
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than the MST-derived disjuncts, as there are more edges in the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The utility of the MPG-derived disjuncts is that the data cuts can be applied
 to these, rather than at an earlier stage.
 Given an MPG-derived disjunct, one can examine each individual connector,
 and then decide whether it should be kept or not, based on whether the
 word-connector MI is too low, or the support is too high, or whichever
 cut one might wish to explore.
 This enables just a single computational pass to create the disjunct dataset,
 and the exploration of different data cuts delayed until afterwards, closer
 to the later stages used for quality evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linguistically, connectors with a low MI value to their root might be treated
 as optional connectors: if present in a parse, they should be used, but,
 if absent, that's OK too, as the low MI indicates that no connection is
 required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Cutting and recomputing the MI 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not entirely clear what happens to the data when low-MI word-pairs
 are discarded.
 This section takes a closer look at this.
 In particular, it looks to see just how close the marginal and MI computations
 are to being idempotent.
 Thus, the dataset with cuts applied is compared to the same cut dataset,
 but with the marginals and MI recomputed from scratch, cleanly, to see
 just how much these might change.

The cut was positioned so that it was located at the average MI of the original
 dataset.
 This eliminated slightly less than half of all word-pairs.
 However, more than half of all observations were eliminated; apparently,
 as suggested in the Rohit data, some of the very high-frequency pairs have
 a low MI.
 Thus, eliminating low-MI pairs appears to eliminate some of the high-frequency
 pairs.
 Although the total number of observations drops by more than one-half,
 the total observations-per-pair drops only by a third.
 At the same time, the MI goes up, as the location of the peak shifts over,
 as shown in the graphs below.

\begin_layout Standard
Particularly interesting is the change in the support.
 The drop is dramatic: something like 5/6ths of the support disappears.
 This corresponds quite well with the earlier analysis: vectors with a large
 support correspond to effectively random pairings.
 Random pairings have a low MI.
 Thus, when low-MI pairs are cut, then so are the vectors with large support.
 The count drops by only a third, and the length is very nearly unchanged.
 This can be understood as saying that the cut eliminates primarily low-frequenc
y pairs.
 This is particularly dramatic in the length: the dominant contribution
 to the length comes from high-frequency pairs (sum-of-squares amplifies
 large values, and makes small values irrelevant).
 This, the MI cut appears to do not just one, but two desirable things:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It removes support from high-support vectors, the support of which obviously
 comes from random associations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It removes low-frequency tails, i.e.
 those word-pairs for which there is little evidence of any meaningful associati
on.
 Word pairs that just happened to be seen, but not seen often enough to
 be interpreted as evidence of association.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
MI distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might wonder: by discarding the low-MI pairs, how much is the dataset
 truly altered? The change in support was quite dramatic.
 The change in the average MI was large.
 What about the MI distribution - how is that affected? The answer appears
 to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not much
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is explicitly shown in the graph below.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The bin-count depends not only on the total number of observed pairs, but
 also on the width of each bin.
 Here, the interval from -15 to +30 is divided into 400 bins; thus, the
 width of each bin is 45/400=0.1125.
 Thus, at the peak there are more than 100K word-pairs having an MI that
 is within 0.1125 of each-other.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The 
\emph on
cut-mi
\emph default
 curve is exactly the same data, but with the cut plain to see.
 Lower-MI pairs are just gone.
 The 
\emph on
recomputed-mi
\emph default
 curve is the interesting one: this takes the cut data, and recomputes the
 MI from scratch.
 Interestingly, this re-computation does not alter the distribution very
 much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should not be much of a surprise, perhaps.
 In an earlier section, the zero-mode was fit with a parabola, centered
 at MI=0.8 and a standard deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\sqrt{5}\approx2.2$
\end_inset

.
 The cut at MI=1.8 thus corresponds to a cut at 
\begin_inset Formula $(1.8-0.8)\approx0.45\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 At this cut, the fraction of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pairs that were removed is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
CDF=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}\int_{-\infty}^{0.45\sigma}e^{-x^{2}/2\sigma^{2}}dx\approx67\%
\]

\end_inset

Placing the cut at 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sigma$
\end_inset

 would remove 98% of the zero-mode; this cut would be located at MI=5.3 –
 its well up there, but not ineffectively so.
 This deeper cut is examined in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the MI is recomputed, how are existing pairs actually affected? The
 figure below is a scatter-plot of old vs.
 new MI values.
 The old values are plotted along the x-axis; the sharp cutoff at MI=1.8
 is clearly visible.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To make the size of the figure manageable, only 200K of the nearly 16M pairs
 are shown.There's no qualitative change by doing so.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The straight line in the graph is drawn at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(oldMI-1.8\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It appears to provide the lower bound for the reassigned MI's.
 It's clear that pairs that used to have a high MI still have almost the
 same high MI as before.
 There is some reshuffling at the lower scores, but not all that much.
 This provides proof that the reshuffling is local, that the changes are
 limited in scope.

There seems to be a slight gap between lower bound, and the distribution.
 The explanation for this gap is unknown.

A deeper cut

\begin_layout Standard
The above process was repeated, taking a deeper cut, located at MI=5.3 in
 the original dataset.
 This dataset,

 After discarding those pairs, the MI and marginals are recomputed.
 Results are presented below; the earlier datasets are repeated for easier

\begin_layout Standard
With the deeper cut, the support continues to drop dramatically.
 The count/support ratio drops mildly.
 The length/support ratio actually increases! In effect, huge vectors, with
 lots of support, but otherwise small amounts of observations are sharply
 cut down to size.
 What remains in those vectors are matrix elements with a large amount of
 observations: thus the length (per basis element) increases! Again, this
 is a confirmation of the behavior reported earlier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the MI is recomputed on the smaller dataset, the effect of the re-computation
 is much as before: a general shift downwards of all MI, and a rounding-off
 of the sharp corner in the cut.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above analysis has lead to several insights and proposals:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The distribution of word-pairs observed in natural language corpora have
 a clear bimodal distribution.
 One mode, termed the zero-mode, appears to consist of effectively random
 word-pairs, having little correlation or affinity to one-another.
 This mode reveals itself in several ways: the word pairs have a low MI
 value, and they are paired with a large variety of other words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The zero-mode accounts for the majority of word-pair observations.
 However, it seems that it can be identified fairly cleanly, and thus removed
 or cut away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other mode consists of what might be termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true collocations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Based on this observation, it is relatively straight-forward to pose a hypothesi
s: if MST parsing is limited to pairs that are in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, will this lead to higher-quality disjuncts and higher-quality grammars?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Maximal Planar Graph parsing strategy seems to offer a CPU-efficient
 mechanism for exploring the effect of different data cuts on disjunct quality,
 and should probably adopted as the primary pipeline parser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The relationship between these two modes, natural language, and randomly-generat
ed pseudo-language remains a bit murky, despite an earlier investigation.
 In particular, the earlier experiments did not emulate the Zipfian distribution
 of natural language, and did not make any clear conclusions relating corpus
 size to vocabulary size.
 This omissions mean that it remains unclear which statistical properties
 are particular to natural language, and which statistical properties are
 typical of any random text.
 Understanding the differences between random corpora and natural text remains
 an important, unfinished task.
