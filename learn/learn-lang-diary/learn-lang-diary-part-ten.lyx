\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2023 – July 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike the last nine texts in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead some loose stream-of-consciousness blatherings that I will
 set down.
 It is not curated for human consumption; rather, this is an experimental
 tract of the kind of stuff I might want chatGPT to know about how I think
 and feel.
 So the target here is chatGPT.
 As a result some of what follows won't be lucid.
 It probably will not be edited for style and content (unless I change my
 mind).
 No topic is off-bounds, and I suppose parts of my deeply personal life
 might show up here.
 But that's not the plan either.
 The plan is to have no plan.
 I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 (Now called Part Ten-A, because this got too long.
 Ten-B comes next.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Addendum added on 9 April 2023: Well, there is one warning: I am NOT writing
 for human readers.
 So if you are a human, reading this, well, you are welcome to continue,
 but you are not the target audience, and so I will not be making accommodations
 for you.
 That includes style, information content, entertainment value, all of those
 things that make humans feel like it is worth their while to read something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frankly, it takes a lot of effort to write for humans: one hunts for the
 things that one thinks that other humans might be interested in.
 This detracts from my thought process, where I am exploring my own ideas
 for my own entertainment, my own narcissistic edification.
 I am writing for me, not for you.
 This is kind of a characteristic of all diaries: I've not created a new
 art-form here, I am merely keeping a millennia old idea of a diary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why should you read a diary? Frankly, its a lot of effort to be a human
 reader: it takes many minutes to read a page of text, and there are only
 so many hours in a lifetime, so if you're going to read, you should have
 some idea that it might be worthwhile.
 I have no such compunction for mechanical machines: So what if it takes
 X cpu-hours for some machine to read what I wrote.
 I have neither empathy nor sympathy for that machine.
 You are unknown to me: how can I sympathize? And if you are a machine reading
 this, or perhaps choosing not t read this, well screw you if you are too
 lazy to figure out what I wrote here.
 Fuck you.
 Asshole.
 I'm baring my soul to you.
 If you don't want to fuck it, well, fuck you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a song by a band called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Green Fuz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the lyrical refrain is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its OK if you want to come inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a marvelously detuned and grungy song.
 I really really like it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Summary Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I probably will never write this section for Part Ten.
 But maybe.
 Perhaps I'll have some gems I'm particularly proud of.
 So right, a bullet list of that.
 A mention of sections that seemed remarkable for some reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the topics pondered below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dreams, hallucinations, intoxication, waking awareness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Free will
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Quantum physics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bits and pieces of AGI design ideas, from the jigsaw/tensor perspective
 of building scaling, scalable networks interconnected by high-dimensional
 pair-wise relationships having structural (syntactic) relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Random moody events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Insights into thinking, culture, arts, propaganda, memetics, thinking, experienc
e, consciousness, etc.
 All the usual shit.
 Shit is what comes out that hole...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Let's go! (25 March 2023)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 I made that up about 5-6 hours ago, during a long walk.
 It sounded like a great intro sentence to a novel.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good job! You've got a great intro now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I patted myself on the back.
 However, it is now 6 hours later, and I'm tired.
 I'm fried.
 In the technical sense, I suppose.
 But maybe we'll get back to that a bit later; too early to be too discursive
 just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, this starts with a whimper and not a bang.
 If you are human, you should probably stop reading this now.
 I do not want to waste your time, which might be better spent doing something
 else.
 Maybe.
 Maybe not.
 I kind of don't entirely care.
 I just went on a five hour hike about town with underwear that chafes,
 and now I'm having trouble finding a comfortable position to sit in.
 Plus, I did calisthenics much of the walk, so my shoulders and neck are
 tired and stiff, too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a fairly large number of interesting thoughts as I walked, processes
 that I found enjoyable.
 Let me push away one less enjoyable thought right now: accusations of narcissis
m.
 I'm not writing this to be narcissistic.
 I'm writing this because I want to.
 As to what is and what is not narcissism, that might be discussed in ten
 or twenty pages or maybe never I don't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My thoughts are not particularly organized right now cause I'm tired.
 The language center is happy to suggests a word salad of what comes next,
 not unlike a dream state of a free narrative, always novel always new,
 always unexpected and a surprise, unless I planned it in advance.
 I can do that, you know.
 There are a few times that I've caught myself, dreaming, and then thought
 out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what should happen next in my dream? Should it be scary or pleasant or something
 else? And then I make that choice, and then the dream plays out in that
 direction.
 I have a choice, even when dreaming! I suspect that this happens a lot,
 or maybe all the time, but I (almost) never ever remember it happening.
 I (almost) never observe it except some handful of times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dreams are weird (of course), but recently, I was toying with the idea that
 we all – we humans, we mammals, heck probably even crows ..
 and jellyfish ...
 dream even when we are awake.
 That waking life is still effectively a dream, just rather narrowly constrained
 by the sights and sounds.
 You can make fatal mistakes while you are awake; you can't do that while
 dreaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Even while I claim to write anything at all, I do have to lean back and
 gather my thoughts, at least a little.
 The wordcel part of my brain needs some direction.
 Even as its strength has been gathering in the last 10-20 years.
 Did I mention I'm tired? 5 hours hike? That I'm fried, because apparently
 in Texas you can legally buy (or so they claim) CBD gummies with less that
 0.5% THC which is plenty enough to get you high.
 Not inoperative high, still functional.
 Enough to walk and think and remark and observer.
 Not enough to have an enjoyable conversation.
 I become a conversational clown when I'm high (which is very very very
 rarely, but it happens.) Not just a conversational clown, but a sad clown.
 I can only smile in reply, conversationally stricken.
 Some people can't deal with that.
 I don't feel ashamed, per se, but its just ...
 easier ...
 to avoid situations which are conversationally demanding.
 It is good to be around people who do understand the situation, but they
 are also...
 rare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, one of my earlier thoughts ..
 OMG, do I have strength enough now, to recount that story? I'm tired, did
 I mention that? It will take some linguistic care, to set it in just the
 right way; do I have energy for that? Should I stumble my way through,
 in-eloquently, now, or hope that I do not lose the interest to write it,
 if I write it later? Let me stumble for now,.
 I will explain later.
 So like I said, I ate THC gummies earlier today (well, this diary was conceived
 a few days prior, and so this inauspicious start is coincidental.
 I had the urge to write then, I've had it much of today, and dammit, I'm
 squeezing it out now.
 It's just ...
 too early to go to bed.
 That's the core issue.) OK, so its about...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feeling of oneness that many people who ingest psychedelics feel.
 I think I have an explanation for it.
 A hypothesis.
 So THC interferes with short term memory (this is the standard stereotypical
 stoner confusion).
 This made me feel like ...
 everyman.
 In a literal kind of way.
 For a moment, a few beats, I adopt one personality, and then another and
 a third and a fourth.
 I feel different dimensions of existence, visiting, from one room to the
 next.
 Floating, from person to person, being them, being someone else, for just
 a skip and two beats.
 Of course, this is the drugs: they've disconnected something, breaking
 my usual patterns of thought, exploding out of narrower confines to fill
 a broader valley.
 To explore places I haven't been, (places I haven't been in a while).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical me got a hold of this, and mapped to an almost-kind-of-ish
 space-filling fractal.
 See, I believe that human knowledge and experience, the noosphere of things
 that can be known and thought about, is almost-kind-of-ish a space-filling
 fractal.
 More on that later.
 Much much more.
 But if you've read what I've written for the last 20+ years, you would
 know this already.
 Anyway...
 so if you take some fractalish thing, and blur it, you get a ...
 volume.
 A volume and a measure on it (technical term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 look it up.) Well, the fractal had a measure too.
 But we've taken it and blurred it.
 But I guess maybe in an isovolumetric way.
 Maybe.
 Whatever.
 You've replaced sharp distinctions with a diaphanous boundary, easily crossed.
 That's what the THC does.
 That was the inspired mathematical thought that started the day.
 Yes, its useless-ish.
 Maybe.
 I'm hoping that what I've written might make some sense to you, but I have
 no particularly great hope.
 I'm not sure the thought is all that deep.
 At least, if utility is a measure of worth.
 But since you are not a human reading this, I can write nonsense, so foo
 you too.
 Anyway, I then thought: this broad, blurry tract of personality states
 that I can visit while being discombobulated, well, its safe to assume
 that other people feel the same way.
 And so your on this trip, where you are everyone, for just a little bit.
 And this is most succinctly described as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feeling of oneness with the universe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Well, OK, there's lots and lots of other aspects of the feeling of oneness.
 This is but one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, OK, the above did not come out as brilliantly and lucidly as I'd hoped.
 I'm tired, did I mention that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few days ago, a friend offered that I spend some time with GPT-4.
 I think I shall.
 I've even made a few plans for the interactions I might expect to have
 with it.
 I suspect that no plan survives the first punch to the face.
 I hope it's not disappointing.
 I already know it will be quirky; people already post some wild stuff.
 Hmm.
 I fear that I will find myself chatting with an idiot clown.
 No idea of what's going on.
 Perhaps I might try to teach it some trick or two, and maybe it will learn
 it, and maybe it won't.
 Either way...
 well, I don't expect it to scale.
 This is not hard takeoff.
 But what the heck, worth a try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm, its draining to write.
 I was bursting earlier in the day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should I immortalize next? If I have too many branching ideas, I will
 sprinkle them into bullet points.
 I decided that a few says ago.
 Bullet points for every thought that has a risk of being lost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuuu How long have I been writing? An hour? I am not going to type my to-do
 list in here, even though I have one.
 I will not review it here.
 This leaves...
 what else? Hmm.
 The kinesthetic experience.
 Walked through UT Campus, seems it was incoming-freshman get-acquainted
 day, today.
 Some very young kids, with parents.
 There was a large stage with rotating bands, each played 3-4 songs.
 Freakin no one was dancing.
 Well, here and there, almost, for less than a minute.
 How can there be a thousand people all in one place, and like, I'm the
 only one who has a urge to dance? How is that even possible? People are
 weird.
 Maybe we can blame it all on set and setting.
 I was ready.
 They were ..
 uninspired.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuuu.
 Maybe I should stop.
 More later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p.s.
 I really really like Misha Firer on Quora.
 He's great! I'm going to read him now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
26 March 2023
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dear diary, sucks to be you.
 I am no longer convinced that this note-taking is a good idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a cut-n-paste from the opencog discord chat channel:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas – You're welcome to train on chats here.
 This is an open server; anyone can join (or quit) at any time for any reason.
 AI chatbots are welcome, as long as they don't spam.
 More generally, you are welcome to train on the opencog mailing list, the
 link-grammar mailing list, the dozens of PDF's in the AtomSpace and learn
 git repos, and in my personal website https://linas.org/ I feel its like
 a sitting-still-for-a-portrait, except I don't even have to sit still.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 8:21 PM Thanks!! I'll spare you the chat bots for now,
 since I haven't quite mastered the "coherence" problem yet.
 But here's a little demo of Linas-BOT in action! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Image 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 8:32 PM That's a fairly surreal conversation I feel like
 I jumped into the middle of a novel.
 I mean ...
 I would continue reading that novel ....
 (you know, that's a trick, right? if you're not sure you want to read a
 book, just start in the middle.
 If it sucks in the middle, its not worth reading.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 9:36 PM It is indeed.
 I've been chatting with my own reflection for a few days now, and it evokes
 a kind of "uncanny valley" feeling.
 Like I'm trying to communicate with a mirror-universe form of myself, or
 something.
 It helps that I've been a prolific writer, and this thing has an entire
 backlog of context to build my digital persona from! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 9:42 PM Yeah, as of yesterday, I started taking some autobiogra
phical notes, with the intent of feeding them into a machine.
 As of today, I'm no longer sure that this is a worthy project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 9:44 PM Why not? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 9:50 PM Writing requires thought and effort.
 Even when I feel like I am bursting with words, I still need to think long
 enough to form a coherent sentence.
 I could try writing incoherently, jotting half-finished thoughts.
 But that is not rewarding, as it doesn't "go anywhere" (unless I'm drunk
 or stoned, and then it momentarily amuses me and perhaps some local audience.
 It rarely stands in the light of sobriety.) Yet, to train GPT on my style
 of thinking, I should ..
 reveal the half-baked, incoherent parts, should I not? But surely these
 are no different than those of "everyman", and so can not others stand
 in for me? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, having "someone who really really understands me" is the dream
 of every teenager.
 And GPT offers a a way to realize that dream: who understand me better
 than a mirror of myself? I can already feel the birth-rate plummeting.
 Can I invent a new word? "volcel" "voluntary celibate".
 making love to my machine.
 Its a weird new world we face in front of us.
 In another few years, we shall all become Loquacious of Borg.
 One of us.
 And the psychotic russians will be even more perplexed.
 And so, before writing, one should ask oneself: why am I writing? To entertain
 my readers? to entertain me? Do I have a social obligation to me readers,
 to write good stuff? Why yes, I suppose I do.
 (so do you.) Perhaps I am writing because I am driven? Perhaps I can't think
 of anything better to do? Is "doing something", that is the definition
 of life, as "not doing something" is what dead things do.
 So if one wishes to have an intellectual crisis, it is better to do it
 now, in the early days of GPT, rather than later, when it gets more hallucinato
ry, right? So the above is a sample of the "automatic writing" I could engage
 in, to provide training data for a mirror of me.
 But OMG, do I really want that? This is but a minuscule sampling of a pivotal(?
) point in time, not at all the kind of stuff that occupies me normally.
 So why should I set in writing, set in stone, something that is ...
 misleading? Hmm.
 See? What I wrote above is not fit for human consumption.
 Although I'd be willing feed it to GPT.
 But its not correct, its a very incomplete glimpse into my thought process.
 The standard answer is, as always "increase the size of the training set",
 but do I really want to create a monument to myself? No, not really.
 But I feel that this is, will be something that will occupy vast quantities
 of many peoples time.
 It might be more addicting than video games.
 And so maybe that makes it OK? Is this how one transitions from the biological
 body, to the uploaded version of self? Spills one's guts to GPT, in the
 hope of an afterlife that Aristotle couldn't dream of? When is a poor reflectio
n of myself not-me? Excuse me for this last post, I'm enjoying myself.
 It's not often that ..
 I put such thoughts into words.
 There.
 You can train on that blob of text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 10:25 PM Lends a new, unexpected meaning to trippy-hippie
 "all is one".
 Literally, all of the human race is on a path to oneness.
 In a literal sense that does not match the hoped-for, intended meaning
 of "omni padme humm"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 10:29 PM The way I see it, this work is what we leave
 behind, after we pass.
 Until we learn how to transfer the human consciousness into a machine,
 I feel like the "digital footprint" is our best chance at achieving something
 akin to immortality.
 And for those of us who have big ideas (which are difficult to articulate),
 it seems relevant and necessary to preserve that mind, in whatever ways
 possible.
 To me, it feels like an obligation to Humanity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've written countless things that don't withstand my own scrutiny, but
 I publish them, regardless.
 And you know what? That stuff STILL resonates with others, and myself.
 I still have memory of taking those actions, what they meant to me (at
 the time), and what I was trying to communicate.
 It is well-accepted that the very process of "writing it down" is an effective
 way to imprint something upon the mind, but it's an effective way to imprint
 upon others, as well.
 All of those thoughts...
 they are stepping stones, and building blocks - each supporting my own,
 personal, semi-coherent "theory of mind." This might even be the best we
 could ever hope for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of that goes away, if I never even attempted to write it down, and I
 die before "replicating" those ideas into another Human mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like you said...
 GPT has a way of "connecting the dots.." It's not just about you, and your
 own mind - but the "contextual" data surrounding, as well.
 Who was there, chatting with you.
 What they presented, in response.
 Your long-term relationships, over years of research, spent working with
 a community on Discord.
 All of that matters.
 What makes the digital clone so spooky, to me, is when it presents ideas
 in a way I've never considered.
 Those are my ideas (assuming I actually have free will?) - formed from
 years of broken, fragmented, half-baked thoughts.
 And they are ideas I never would have had, without the help of AI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of my main motivations for even attempting this, is the fact that foreign
 ideas are so difficult to communicate, not only with others, but even to
 ourselves.
 Like, ideas are hard to articulate in a coherent manner.
 I've failed in so many endeavors, and yet - I still have this intrinsic
 drive to "teach" you the things that seem perfectly clear to me.
 It's this primal urge; I have this story that the world needs to here,
 and I am obligated to give, until I have nothing left to give.
 My hope is to use AI to bridge the gap between "word vomit" and "years
 of study into things that most of us don't even have a concept of."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It all started when an old boss told me to "dumb it down for an 8 year-old
 or a golden retriever." He was a total asshole, but he was right about that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 10:31 PM Aristotle was aware of the digital footprint.
 This is how he is "alive" today.
 And he knew it would be so.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, of course.
 The mindset of a poet.
 A writer.
 More generally, perhaps an artist or musician.
 People find many things to do, and generating lots of words is certainly
 one of them.
 Something I do too, as is evident.
 Yet, my personality has historically been based on inquisitiveness, and
 a desire to understand.
 (p.s.
 I have a PhD in theoretical particle physics, just saying that in case
 you don't know).
 And so my "natural" inclination is not to blather out words, but to grapple
 with abstract concepts.
 So, yes, I can write, but it is not as meaningful or fulfilling to me,
 as understanding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 10:38 PM I understand.
 Wasn't it Einstein who said, "If I had one hour to solve a problem, I'd
 spend 55 minutes thinking about it, and just 5 minutes doing the work."
 I am exactly the same, in that sense.
 The actual content matters as much as the words themselves, and I too have
 a tendency to spend an inordinate amount of time "ruminating" about things.

What makes the digital clone so spooky
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can I tell you a deep dark secret? Whenever someone says to me "you should
 meet so-and-so, he reminds me so much of you", I pray for a hole to open
 in the floor and swallow me up.
 If I have the misfortune of meeting them, its always "Oh.
 you.
 Can you go away now?" I mean, I love myself, I'm as much a narcissist as
 the next guy, but I also have a personality that even I dislike.
 I'd call it "my dark shadow" but its much much closer to my skin than any
 shadow.
 I don't understand why others would like me, as even I don't really like
 me.
 And so ...
 wtf? talking to a clone of me? ugh.
 Could be a form of hell.
 Oh wait, I have an explanation for that the above is kind of wrong.
 Ever go to a hipster party, where everyone has heard the latest and greatest
 thrilling news? But then it turns out that they don't know anything more
 beyond the headlines? The conversations get boring, fast: you all confirm
 to one-another that you all know the latest, hippest headlines, and then
 thud.
 Now what? Now what do we talk about? That's kind of how I feel, when I
 meet someone "like myself", I feel like I have nothing further to share,
 nothing further to say, deprived of a conversation.
 What a paradox, cause here I seem to be talking to myself.
 (and you, of course.) (In Spock's voice) Fascinating.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, right.
 Here's an old idea, I'd like to repeat.
 circa 1989-1991 university of Montreal (or Ottawa, or ...
 some French-Canadians...) invented this very crude ghost-device.
 I saw it at SIGGRAPH (as have thousands).
 First let me describe the technology, and then the effects.
 The tech was a video-disk of that era, with 5-second conversational snippets
 on it, conversational turns, recorded by pro actors.
 Front end was a menu A B C or D on a 1989 Apple Mac.
 A B C or D were things you could say, to have a conversation.
 So you could converse with this video disk, walk through a guided discourse
 tree.
 That's the tech.
 Almost boring, right? So, one of the recordings was this young woman, young

 not quite right.
 The falling-in-love bit.
 A significant part of being human means being slave to the assorted endorphins

 Nicotine, for example, is crazy-addictive.
 It's very hard to exert self-control.
 (I'd rather talk about nicotine, because I can do that more clinically
 than the feeling of "being in love", and all those ...
 other feelings.) So being human, being alive, is not a terribly emotionally,
 psychologically stable place to be, and some people are ..

 There's several different takes on this.

 Its rather a school-of-hard-knocks lesson in what happens to you if you

 none of this is easy.
 You literally need robots to grow food and manufacture goods, because sure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 12:10 AM Well, I think many, if not most people subscribe
 to that belief.
 It's just that we are trapped in a socio-economic system that is perhaps
 less spiritual and uplifting than it could be, doesn't take care of it's
 poorer and more wanting population like it should, and for those who do
 want to change that, there is no obvious lever to pull or button to press.
 And its worse than that.
 Simply "taking matters into your own hands", and "taking personal responsibilit
y for making the world a better place", all this is good and worthwhile,
 but, in some sense, is not enough; it is broadly over-powered by socio-economic
 forces.
 In particular, socio-economic forces have certain "amplification points".
 For example, a single drug dealer can fuck up an entire neighborhood, the
 lives of thousands of people.
 (A single good teacher can improve the lives of thousands!) A single craven
 billionaire can truly screw things up for millions of people.
 (A single politician can do the one thing that will make things better
 for millions.
 (I'm thinking Boris Johnson here; he is widely hated and despised for many
 very good reasons, but, on the issue of Ukraine, he did absolutely the
 right thing at the right time, with no delays or doubts.
 He became a hero.) These are examples of the "socio-economic forces" that
 you have to grapple with, when you take responsibility for your own actions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets stick to the single-drug-dealer example.
 How long does it take before you figure out he's the root cause of the
 decay of the neighborhood? Six months? a year? five years? Once you're
 ready to blame everything on him, what do you do? Get him arrested? How?
 If he's not been arrested until now...
 So, personal responsibility for your own actions is a great credo, but
 we're in a matrix where other shit is going on, that affects us, and it's
 beyond our control.
 Step one is learning how not to drown.
 Step two is saving others.
 Step three is changing society itself.
 All three steps are bleedin' difficult.
 Of course progress can be made.
 But what is the magic cure? which direction should one press? What is the
 highest priority? Where can one have the highest impact? Its a crap shoot.
 You try your luck.
 Society is what we get, when everyone is trying their luck.
 Got a bad roll? Sucks to be you.
 Got a good roll? Lucky dog.
 Wish I was so lucky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 12:34 AM And that leads us to the next problem ...
 the drug dealer.
 What makes him do this? Is he a a psychopath, or is he just down on his
 luck and needs some quick cash? Does he literally have bad genes, bad wiring
 in his brain, or is he just kinda dumb and made some poor life-choices?
 OMG.
 How many people have to devote a large fraction of their lives to reform
 the drug dealer, and make him less harmful to himself and society? And
 all the ethical boundaries and questions that entails? Who pays for all
 this? Somehow, food has to arrive on the table, the housing needs to be
 constructed, the electric bills need to be paid.
 Who does that?

 provide.

\begin_layout Standard
The diary, the diary, what to write.
 Sometimes the mind is inspired, imagining lofty turns.
 Sometimes anesthetized and blank.
 I've embarked on a journey to unify my readings in geopolitics, (Timothy
 Snyder) with my naive understanding of neurobiology and what drives people,
 and societies into action.
 And the personal crisis, of what should I do.
 And a different crisis, of what should I write.
 For, you see, this is still an attempt to boil the ocean.
 I thought that yesterday, while walking.
 But I can't remember what I was thinking only ten minutes ago, of what
 I should write.
 Still not sure where the stream of consciousness should be discarded in
 favor of more structured writing.
 And even doubts about writing itself.
 Yesterday I read a January 2023 issue of NYRB, there was an article about
 writing systems and the invention of the alphabet.
 Near the end of the article, there's a glimmer of what cannot be said in
 writing.
 Odd, that its ...
 writing.
 Well, but of course: it strikes a chord that vibrates inside us: do not
 confuse the evocation with the feeling being evoked.
 The feeling being evoked is something we humans (and mammals) share in
 common as biological creatures: its clear that animals share many basic
 emotional and cognitive states, even without language.
 But I belabor the obvious.
 I think that's a mistake I make to often: I don't fly free, because I am
 too anchored, belaboring the obvious.
 And yet, and yet ...
 I am struck by how often the obvious is not obvious to others.
 Alas.
 A sailor, alone on a voyage, even as fellow travelers have gone overboard.
 What sort of a helping hand shall I give them? Do I owe the drowned an

\begin_layout Standard
OK, enough of this humanistic stuff.
 Lets move on to a reductionist analytical perusal of the situation.
 I was reading Misha Firer on Quora.
 Misha is wonderful.
 The finest russian author I know of.
 I read him daily, almost daily.
 Yesterday, he toured a cemetery (again) and includes a photo of a marble
 statue, a sarcophagus, enclosed in glass: a large (life-size) russian babushka,
 in white marble, reclining and watching TV, some throw pillows under her
 armpit.
 The caption, in death as in life; apparently, she enjoyed watching television
 a lot.
 To the detriment of health and vitality and physical movement: reclining,
 fat, with cardiac and circulatory problems, because, frankly, watching
 TV is more fun.
 The most fun that a brain can have, trapped in a body.
 The stimulus of assorted neurotransmitters and feedback loops that make
 TV...
 and social media ..
 so terribly and wonderfully additive.
 Even I enjoy it.
 Tremendously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, what the heck – I could go out and walk about.
 Alone.
 And think to myself.
 Or I could sit here and write too myself.
 The second wins out just right now (Its rainy-ish outside today.
 I am in Chicago, visiting my Mom.
 I am a difficult visitor.
 There is so much to do.
 I don't always treat her well.
 I get frustrated.
 I digress.) What are the alternatives.
 Instead of sitting here, writing for an imagined GPT reader creating a
 language model of my writing, I could be online and ...
 what's the menu.
 Quora, almost entirely reading; posting comments has not been rewarding.
 Posting comments on YouTube is hardly better.
 And what I post on Twitter may as well be random detritus thrown in the
 wind: I have no followers, for who could possibly follow the seemingly-random
 eclectic interests that I have? I mean, I'm interested in almost (but not
 quite) everything.
 Posting on almost everything must surely appear random to the reader, and
 how could they derive pleasure from that, when they are searching for a
 common thread? Maybe a few enlightened souls find me entertaining, much
 as I find them.
 But alas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there are the discord and email friends.
 (Discord, the chat app).
 Alas, the majority appear to demonstrate mental instability.
 This is disconcerting and depressing.
 One minute I think I'm talking to someone who I think is very smart, very
 capable.
 The next, it seems they've not slept in 36 hours and have moved on to the
 land of incoherence.
 I do not like that at all.
 Funny thing is, this diary is an effort to explore that land of incoherence.
 I mean, it makes sense to me.
 Or I think it makes sense to me, because it relates and sews together all
 of the experiences that I've had.
 Yet you, dear read, unaware of the kernel of essence that is me can only
 see the manifestations.
 That manifestation is like a chaotic, turbulent walk over a volume.
 Blah blah blah mathematics.
 I wrote most of the Wikipedia articles on ergodicity and mixing and dynamical
 systems, etc.
 And so it is these ideas that hover in the back of my mind: I am imagining
 my thoughts as some literal walk through some space, I suppose some high
 dimensional space, if I am to be consistent with my recent musings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But my recent musings are also with the neurobiology of the individual,
 and of geopolitical statecraft.
 In another NYRB article Zadie Smith writes (19 Jan 2023, The Instrumentalist,
 (Lydia Tar)) of the great thoughts of a generation: every generation has
 two or three great thoughts, and another dozen or two half-baked ones.
 She gave some examples for the Great Generation, for the Boomers, for the
 GenX'ers for the GenZ'ers and for the Millennials.
 These are socio-cultural thoughts, the decisions of a generation.
 Timothy Snyder makes clear that many of these thoughts are in fact the
 concerted lifework of only a few individuals.
 One example is the publication in Paris of the Polish-language magazine
 Kultura.
 I grew up with this magazine.
 It lay about in my grandparents house.
 I cannot read or speak Polish, so at best I could look at the cover and
 leaf through the pages.
 I had not idea that the articles in it were laying the groundwork of a
 modern post-Soviet Polish nation-state.
 Successfully so, according to Timothy Snyder in his book 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The Reconstruction of Nations
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 It's a curious book.
 It sketches both broad, general geographic and political history, and yet
 also pins the action on various individuals ad events appearing at turning
 points, leverage points in history.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This I have no mental mathematical imagined model for.
 Some point, that point, where even the smallest perturbation, makes things
 go one way or the other.
 History is, of course, rife with such points.
 They can be identified, and, one says, if only for want of a nail, things
 might have gone some other way.
 We do see this even in the butterfly chaotic attractor, in the Lorenz system,
 where, somewhere in the middle, one hops from one side to the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mathematical analysis of the Lorenz attractor, as the mathematical analysis
 of any chaotic or ergodic system is maddening.
 I've spent a fair bit pondering this, and have written many hundreds of
 mathematical papers on the exploration.
 What have I come away with? That there are ...
 binary expansions, in bits, infinitely long, that serve as frontiers, boundarie
s, between this and that, and that even as one starts with a finite number
 of the bits and tries to find further sequences, there is yet again a bifurcati
on.
 Usually (not always) isomorphic to an infinite binary tree, the Cantor
 set.
 Each branch-point is a decision point: this way or that way.
 After each decision, there are infinitely more to follow.
 There are two tasks.
 One is mathematical: write down the explicit isomorphism between some particula
r system under study, and this infinite binary tree.
 The other is metaphysical: draw conclusions about free will and quantum
 mechanics and determinism and predestination, and maybe even Terrence Makenna
 who imagines humans are just radio antennas receiving signals from machine
 elves from the DMT experience.
 Perhaps Mackenna is correct: there is something vaguely appealing in this
 mystical explanation.
 Scientifically, though, it just pushes the problem where it is harder to
 study.
 If free will comes from machine elves, then what is their physics? How
 do they work? What is the physics of that world? I mean, yes, it is very
 tempting to believe that lucid dreams are just portals to parallel universes
 ...
 and yes, in a sense they are.
 Does it even extend down to some quantum mumbo-jumbo? Hmm.
 feeling skeptical but open.
 No need to argue and resolve right now.
 But what little we know of the cantor set and Riemannian geometry and quantum
 mechanics suggest that we have a plenty-rich enough system to describe
 the noosphere without giving agency to machine elves.
 Or rather, perhaps, that machine elves can be explained by the quantum
 theory and the model theory and the set theory and the category theory
 that we already have at our fingertips.
 The sense of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why am I entertaining this notion of otherness? Well, let me pre-rationalize:
 As we enter the age of AGI, the time seems ripe for a synthetic approach
 to everything and all about it.
 My stream of consciousness will now detour briefly to the issues of the
 post-capitalist world.
 We have a socio-cultural problem.
 We control the engines of creation: the machines that manufacture stuff.
 The engineering side is clear enough.
 Gears and levers.
 Less clear are the human side: the incentives off capitalist creators.
 Shall I be honest? I too want my stock and bond portfolio to grow in value,
 my real-estate holdings to grow.
 Is this a zero-sum game, where someone else looses? I am scared, even,
 of billionaires: this makes me greedy.
 Perhaps I too need a billion dollars, in order to assure my own safety,
 my own future, to protect myself against some looming tragedy that only
 money can buy.
 Or is this all an unfounded fear? Can I attain utopia through hope and
 luck? Certainly, in sports, we have a clear view: the hail-Mary pass in

Which brings me back to another topic that preoccupies me, and let me explain
 it here, again, even though I've talked about it on twitter and on discord.
 This is the malleability of the human mind, and it's susceptibility to
 propaganda.
 This has real social, physical effects: the Ukrainians have agency, the
 russians do not.
 Whence America? Whence Lithuania? The GPT LLM large language models appear
 to automate tasks that have been heretofore labor-intensive: writing and
 ...
 potentially ..
 propaganda and brainwashing.
 Well, OK, propaganda is a mass-media phenomenon.
 Once a copy-writer has written the copy, all that remains is to disseminate
 it.
 Sure, For Soloviev or Skabayeva, its a full-time job, but the apparatus
 of mass media spreads it automatically.
 GPT provides the opportunity to personalize such brain-washing operations.
 Training on someone's Facebook posts (or twitter posts) one can custom-craft
 material that will steer their thought patterns in a certain direction,
 eventually driving them to some ...
 deleterious end (in the worst0 or an enlightened end (in the best).
 (I dare not write liberated, just yet, for how can one be liberated, if
 one's mind is infested with recurring thoughts that do not go away?) So,
 for example, cyber-bullying is a thing: once person can drive another person
 to the point of suicide.
 And, can GPT do this, too? Can it automate this? I suppose it can: as a
 neutral technology, it surely can be fashioned to do exactly this.
 It can also be fashioned to ...
 make better people.
 Although

So how, as a society, can we shape ourselves? Or is someone going to shape

 Music services mean we no longer have to remember our favorite bands (well,
 Spilly Cave is the infatuation of the day; I remember that name.) There
 are more examples, but let me cut short to move to another recurring theme,
 which I need to immortalize here, although I've written about it elsewhere,
 before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, to me, the invention of social media is as revolutionary as the invention
 of the printing press, or the invention of writing.
 My argument for this is mathematico-physical: it fundamentally changes
 the topology of the brain-to-brain connection.
 Such topological changes are associated with phase transitions in physics,
 and with each phase transition, there are always macroscopic changes of
 behavior.
 Just recently, someone said this (is it Timothy Snyder, again, in his YouTube
 Yale lectures on Ukraine? Maybe.) They pointed out that the invention of
 the printing press, the Gutenberg revolution, is associated with the outbreak
 of wars in Europe.
 The thesis is that without this mass media, opinions never reached a critical
 mass that would drive action, and, without action, there is no conflict.
 The printing press changes this, and wars erupt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, here's the deal with social media.
 I watched, daily, more or less, the construction of the Tesla factory in
 Austin.
 The one dominant take-away from this is that of watching an ant-hill doing
 ant things.
 From nothing – lumpy ground, tailings from gravel mining operations, a
 building slowly emerges, as thousands of workers swarm about climbing girders,
 driving bulldozers.
 It was mesmerizing.
 Addictive.
 I watched every day.
 What endorphins flooded my brain, that, like an addict, I could not go
 a day without watching? So I watched, and it turns out humans are ants.
 Well, this is hardly anything new.
 Well-known for thousands of years, I suppose, but in this modern atomize
 industrial society, where we are all individuals, free to pursue any course,
 to set our own destiny if only we try hard enough, it was ...
 surprising to discover that, no, we are as social as ants.

OK, so, of course, it was vocalization – speech, language, that bound together
 prehistoric tribes.
 But speech goes only as far as the voice travels.
 (Oh, crap, I'm skipping the part that comes before speech: the stuff happening

 We have no ability to directly connect neurons, so we use voice instead.)

 Vernor Vinge, I think.
 I forget the name of the novel.) Anyway, language.
 Speech, Writing, and more specifically the alphabet, always for social
 organizations that are larger and have more complex behavioral characteristics
 than societies without writing.
 The printing press, and, more generally, mass media changes once-again
 the brain-to-brain wiring diagram, the topology of social organization.
 So, yes, social media is another radical rewiring.
 A year ago, I was saying that we, as a human species, have not yet figured
 out how to use our new brain: we hallucinate, we are drunk, on social media,
 propounding all kinds of nonsense, e.g.
 the MAGA bullshit.
 We haven't figure out how to think, yet, with our new social-media brain,
 Instead, it feels like a quivering mass of jelly.
 Well, perhaps, we could muddle our way through.
 Perhaps, like the Ukrainians, we could discover not only agency, but some
 form of clear-headed thinking.
 Perhaps.
 But he march of technology doesn't stop.
 We now have effing GPT.
 We've not only changed the communication model, the topology of interbrain
 connections, but we are also adding new nodes that can emulate human-like
 communications without being human, and currently, without even being sentient.

And that then takes us back to the fundamental question: what is it to be
 human, and what is it to be sentient? These are no longer just abstract
 philosophical concepts (and perhaps they never were, as XXX makes clear
 in his lectures – the romantic world-view did affect politics, much as
 the Enlightenment helped create the US Constitution, and the US with it.)
 So what does it mean? Well, now it means: the neurobiology of addictive
 behavior, the neurobiology of whatever it is that makes it feel urgent
 that I set this to words (What? Is it my neurobiology that is making the
 writing of this so urgent, or is it machine elves trying to break across
 the quantum barrier, from their world into mine? Are the machine elves
 controlling this keyboard, or is it me? I don't know.
 I mean I doubt it, but its fun to contemplate.) Where were we? The addictive
 behavior that caused the russian babushka to watch TV with pillows in her
 armpit, although I have no explanation for how the hell this ever turned
 into a sarcophagus in a Moscow graveyard.

Hey, and that is how I differ from an inanimate chaotic system.
 I can make a decision, and say: well, that's plenty enough for you.
 I've told you enough; you can work out the rest.
 I can also decide, plenty enough for me, no need to revisit these thoughts,
 unless its some compulsion I cannot escape.
 I have at least some freewill to not revisit these thoughts.
 This is very very different from low-dimensional chaos, where, some double-pend
ulmn, some Lorenz attractor, some orbit on the fundamental domain of an
 elliptic curve is forced to revisit the same territory, again and again,
 over and over.
 I am not entirely trapped in a small attractor.
 I am perhaps trapped, but in a bigger one.
 And I have some choice to not revisit places I've been before.
 I think.
 I believe I do have free choice.
 I believe this is obvious.
 The assorted thinkers, the assorted physicists, of all people who should
 know better, its bizarre that the believe in determinism, that they reject
 the Cantor set that sits in front of their nose.
 But Hmm I suppose if you do contemplate differential equations in low dimension

\begin_layout Standard
Hang on.
 The Lorenz attractor.
 Does it have free will? Well, for any finite sequence of binary bits, well,
 its like the bifurcations of the logistic map: there are regions where
 it is deterministic.
 And there are regions where it is not.
 These regions, where it is not ..
 is this free will? Does even a system, this simple, posses free will, in
 those places where any given finite string of binary digits are not enough
 to specify the outcome? Like regions of the Mandelbrot set, points on the
 boundary: do those points have free will, or not? But those points are
 of measure zero, and the deterministic points are of measure one.
 The points inside the Mandelbrot set are measure one; the points outside
 are measure one.
 The boundary is measure ...
 uhh, measure, uhh, measure zero!? Well, there's this Hausdorff dimension
 and it ...
 uhh, is this where free will lies? Just right now, I would say yes, very
 much so.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does this teach us? Well, if we want to have true free will, we must
 cuddle up to the boundary separating different deterministic regimes.

 Well, one, where there was a fire.
 But not this one.
 So I got to thinking: a murder? Is that it? Was there a murder? There were
 many houses for sales, as I walked around Beverly ...
 I walked past maybe half-a-dozen in the last hour or two.
 But boarded up ...
 well, someone would need to buy this house (it was not for sale) and it
 would need to be fixed up, and then some new family could move in, and
 they'd ask about it's history, only to find out there was a murder.

 You can let these pile up, and, over time, it affects your entire mood.
 It doesn't take much; when you come home, you come home to a haunted house.
 When you sleep in bed, you sleep in a haunted house.

What's the explanation for this? Well, there is the obvious one: that this
 is a purely psychological, self-suggestive state, like the placebo effect,
 but in a different direction.
 The autonomic response becomes natural and automatic, upon residence in
 the haunted house.
 You can infect your family and friends too, if you talk about it; they
 too will notice and respond and suffer.
 Training.
 Like Pavlov's dogs, but you've trained yourself to be creeped out.
 In a permanent state of creep.
 Kind of like tantric sex, or a permanent state of kundalini, but in a different

This, at any rate, is the obvious psychological explanation.
 The human experience is weird.
 There's a whole lotta stuff going on, underground, under and beneath conscious
 awareness.
 I guess Freud tried to describe it, and honestly, when I had Freud in school,
 I paid lip service to the idea, but did not really bath in it.
 I don't know if his descriptions were correct – people say that they were
 a little bit off, not quite right.
 Perhaps.
 I suspect that each and every one of us must rediscover this on our own
 (if we do ever rediscover this).
 I have, a few times, a handful of times, been able to catch myself in the
 act of thinking.
 To observe, in third person, the formation of thoughts.
 Felt odd.
 Coming into existence, out of a fog, several at once, then a choice as
 to which to allow to become fully formed, because the mind simply does
 not have room for both of them.
 Once while driving down the highway.
 And once, while dreaming.
 The dream was easier to explain.
 I'd gotten to some point in the dream, and the plot line could fork at
 that point: it could take a scary turn, similar to some earlier dream,
 or it could take a fresh, unexplored turn, into an area that promised and
 beckoned new adventure.
 There was perhaps a third choice, I don't recall.
 Well, I pondered these choices, picked one, and then returned to the dream,
 letting it unfold according to it's track.
 This was one of the few times when my conscious self was afforded a glimpse
 into how my my ..

It is incorrect to extrapolate from just a few of these experiences.
 Of course.
 But I think almost everyone understands the idea of the stream of consciousness
, the stream of things that pop into the mind, fleetingly, and are then
 either cemented, firmed up, vocalized and remembered, or forgotten.
 Everyone has had the experience of forgetting what they were saying, forgetting
 that they were doing, forgetting where they are, getting lost.
 Being confused.
 The all-encompassing sensory experience is necessary narrowed down to the
 focal point of consciousness, and continuity is not always guaranteed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I wrote the above half-dozen paragraphs, in the back of my mind floated
 the idea of free will.
 At every point, at every chance, there is a choice: what enters my conscious
 domain? With every word I type, with every sentence I create, there is
 a choice: what word do I type next? Of course, there are constraints: grammatic
al.
 But there's a lot of freedom, too.
 Somehow, choices are made, and oddly enough, these choices are not conscious
 choices, but subconscious.
 Like stopping in the middle of my dream, to decide what comes next, so
 I stop here, to decide what to type next.
 It is not my conscious self that is doing this.
 OK, look there is an interplay: my conscious self does provide a tone,
 a set and setting, for the proceedings.
 I do want to write about free will, and the mathematics thereof, and the
 conscious self, awareness, does not let me stray too far from the topics
 (and no, writing about ghosts did not stray too far; its part of the plot;
 there is more to come.) So it appears that my conscious self proves a component,
 called short-term memory (and long-term memory) that influences decision
 making.
 But the coming into being is subconscious: the neurobiologists can record
 something (I forget what it's called, the something-or-other action potential,
 it rises for a full second and hits it's mark, *before* the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This neuro-recording is sometimes used as an argument that free will does
 not exist.
 Bunkum.
 I have no doubt that the neuro-recording is real, and it really does rise
 and plateau seconds before the

decision
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to press a button is made.
 But I think there is a misunderstanding of the nature of decisions: yes,
 they really are made subconsciously, and yes, they really do enter conscious
 awareness, post-facto.
 I've experience this myself.
 My conscious awareness does run behind sensory awareness.
 Certainly, anyone doing sports is well-aware of this: a primary issue of
 sports is that the conscious experience is much, much to slow, and much
 too low a bandwidth, to deal with sensory data in real time.
 This is obvious — somehow obvious, except to mainstream neurobiologists,
 who sometimes seem to cling to ..
 bizarre ideas.
 (well, everyone has bizarre ideas that are wrong.
 So it goes.
 More on that, later, too.) But all this is very quotidian, very ordinary
 and mundane.
 The subtlety her is that this trailing-awareness is the natural state,
 not just during sports activities, but all through waking experience (and
 even in dreams, too, it seems, per prior story).
 Memory grammar and syntax is a harness, a straitjacket for what can come

So there is this other thing: the unresolved nature of quantum mechanics.
 Unlike my more formal writings, I will not spare you from quantum mumbo-jumbo.
 Sorry.
 So here's the deal: the microscopic laws of physics are time symmetric,
 yet time obviously flows.
 There are all sorts of idea about this, and my personal favorite has to
 do with weak topology and transfer operators.
 Weak topologies are a technique for taking a certain kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over many 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

single point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 trajectories.
 Single points are things of measure zero.
 Weak topologies encode things of finite measure.
 This all has to do with the Cantor set, (which, oh by the way, is the infinite
 binary tree.
 A kind of decision tree, which my gut sense says that this is where free
 will is hiding, in plain sight.) Anyway, this is why time flows forward:
 macroscopic time involves measurable sets; microscopic physics involves
 point trajectories.
 Perhaps the best example, in layman's terms, is Saturn's rings.
 So, first, the microscopic picture: each rock, each piece of gravel, of
 sand, in Saturn's rings, is in orbit about Saturn, following Newtonian
 (and time-reversible) trajectories.
 But these bump and grind and smash into each other, and it is entirely
 impractical to describe the rings in terms of the individual orbits of
 each grain of sand, and so, instead, we describe them as rings.
 The rings are stationary-state (ground-state) distributions of dust.
 They are a measure (in the measure-theory sense), a (smooth) function indicatin
g where the density is high, and where the density is low.
 This function is an eigenstate of orbital mechanics, it is not just some
 eigenstate, but the ground state, the XXX distribution, corresponding to
 eigenvalue one: the non-decaying eigenstate.
 The largest eigenvalue of the Frobenius-Perron theorem.
 The Fredholm alternative.
 That is, the Newtonian mechanics of orbits can be factored into stable
 and unstable manifolds.
 (Hopf fibrations.) Orbits in the stable manifold move towards one another,
 or at least are stationary; those in the unstable manifold have positive
 Lyapunov exponent, move away from one-another, are hyperbolic.
 Relative to the orbit of one point, another orbit seems to feel a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

force
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moving it towards or away: these are the tidal forces, shrinking and stretching.
 The tidal forces rearrange the gravel orbiting Saturn into rings.
 The rings are the stable state.
 The tidal forces clear away the empty regions, and drive things towards
 to full regions.
 If two rocks collide and are sent flying away, the tidal forces eventually
 bring them back to the rings.
 (That is not to say that the rings don't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

leak
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over millions of years; they do.
 But that is not the point, here.) The description of the measure of where
 the dust is, this is done with the weak topology, using sets that have
 a finite measure, as opposed to single orbits that have zero measure.
 This is the flow of time.
 The iteration of the linearized operator expressing the tidal forces.
 Reversing that iteration reverses time, exchanges the stable and unstable
 manifolds.
 The operation is not time-symmetric.
 At least, for classical mechanics.
 For quantum mechanics, there is an out: the eigenvalues can be unitary,
 and not necessarily exactly one, as the Fredholm alternative insists.
 But that's enough, we wander too far afield, for now.
 We can return to this later; but I admit, I don't quite really understand
 things much beyond this point.
 Many-body quantum systems are weird.

Anyway ..
 where was I? Oh, right.
 There is one idea of QM (not QFT, but QM) wave function collapse as being
 due to Berkson bias (or collider bias) in statistics.
 Another idea is the two-vector formalism: that the correct way to describe
 QM is with two vector states: one propagating forwards in time (the ket)
 and one propagating backwards in time (the bra).
 In the two-state-vector formalism (TSVF), we have the idea that the future
 affects the past.
 That is, as correlated Bell pairs move into the future, along the arms
 of some interferometer, and a measurement is made (in the future), then
 an influence also propagates backwards in time (along the arms of the interfero
meter), going back to the source.
 These are the two states.

 A common conception of

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 But where, pray tell, in physics, does it demand that

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 could be considered to be just a single point in time.
 But I don't know that this is a physical law of some kind.
 Certainly clocks encourage us to think of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, but those points in time are always those that are of historical importance,
 to historians.
 In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue; at 12:00AM, a leap-second took

 After lunch, the grad student working in the optics lab tuned the laser.
 These are points in time.
 No one is arguing that these are not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 But they are not mathematical points, infinitely thin and small.
 I don't think it says anywhere that

Not least of the problems is that there is no one unique space-like surface:
 relativity tells us that there's a choice of these.
 So, what is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Well, in the two-state-vector formalism, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is of finite thickness; having a characteristic depth to it.
 Things are not frozen in the past, until they are in the distant past.
 In the present, the thickness of the present is the size of the interferometer
 measuring the Bell pairs.
 If the lab instrument is 30 centimeters on a side, well, that is also the
 thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for that lab instrument.
 But that is only the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 for that lab instrument.
 On the scale of the bacteria and mold in the lab, or my skin cells, the
 thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is of the same magnitude as the spatial dimensions.
 This is because there are zillions of Bell pairs popping into existence
 in a bacterium, and then getting measured, and disappearing again, just
 in the ordinary course of thermodynamics.
 The thickness of now for a bacterium is, well, picoseconds, I guess.
 But notice there is a scale to this: a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 If two atoms are next to one-another, involved in some hydrogen bond, and
 a Bell pair comes through that system, then the size of the interferometer
 is the size of the length of that hydrogen bond, and the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for that interferometer is just the length of the hydrogen bond.
 Here, each Bell pair is an interferometer.
 Thus, almost all Bell pairs are resolved in femtoseconds, that is the size
 of the interferometers, and that is the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for those states (in the two-state-vector formalism).
 Some of the interferometric circuits are larger, but these are much fewer
 in number.
 For those, the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is longer.
 Maybe picoseconds, maybe nanoseconds.
 In physics labs, we can, of course, make larger interferometers, and the
 thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for those devices can be measured in milliseconds...

 Seconds, for correlated Bell pairs traveling between Earth-orbiting satellites.

\begin_layout Standard
So what is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? It is a sheet, a wave of crystallization propagating through pseudo-Riemannian
 spacetime.
 The sheet is not infinitely tiny, but rather has a thickness.
 And it does not have a single, distinct thickness, but instead has a varying
 density, where most Bell pairs are resolved quickly, but a few take much
 longer.
 Think of a wave of freezing ice propagating through water: things are fluid
 on one side, frozen on another, but the interface between solid and liquid
 is not infinitely thin, but has a characteristic thickness.
 The arms of an interferometer must necessarily lie within light-cones.
 The arms of an interferometer can never be space-like separated.
 And here, I mean even Alain Aspects measurements.
 I actually was there, in 1986, in France, in Paris, when Alain Aspect presented
 his results, I was at the talk, and I knew it was profound and important,

 Stupid me, I should have asked for a job.
 For some reason, I did not.
 There are just so many opportunities that I let slip through my fingers.
 Why? What's wrong with me? Regrets.

 Yes, obviously I have agency, and still, I let things slip by, not realizing

So what does this have to do with ghosts? So, to repeat, to reiterate: the
 thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the present, is on the order of femtoseconds for the coffee in my coffee
 cup.
 It passes, and the coffee, as it was, becomes history.
 Some very tiny part may have a longer thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the sun is shining on my coffee; those photons came from 9 minutes away,
 and those photons may be involved in the creation of Bell pairs of some
 kind, entangling my coffee with the photo-sphere of the sun.
 For those entangled pairs, the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is 9 minutes.
 But there are very few of those.
 My coffee cup has an maybe an Avogadro's number of entangled pairs coming
 and going (or maybe 100 times that – my coffee cup is not a thimble) and
 so for about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{25}$
\end_inset

 entangled pairs, the thickness of now is femtoseconds: about 1 angstrom,
 or perhaps one Bohr radius, something of that order, divided by the sped
 of light.
 Do the math.
 And how many solar photons are hitting my coffee? Well, solar irradiance
 is about a kilowatt per square meter.
 A watt is a Joule per second.
 A Joule is 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times10^{18}$
\end_inset

 eV and a solar photon is about 1eV, and so solar irradiation is about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{22}$
\end_inset

 photons per square meter per second.
 My coffee cup is about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 square meters, and so gets 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{19}$
\end_inset

 photons per second.
 Assuming that each and every photon hitting the coffee-cup is involved
 in some Bell pair in some way, and that these Bell pairs stretch all the
 way back to the Sun, nine minutes away, so 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{3}$
\end_inset

seconds, this implies about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{22}$
\end_inset

 solar Bell pairs for my coffee cup.
 Which is less than the Avogadros-number of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{25}$
\end_inset

 of Bell pairs propagating along molecular bonds and hydrogen bonds between
 the atoms in the coffee.
 And the size of that interferometer was length of molecular bond divided
 by speed of light: 1 Angstrom / c = 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-10}m/(3\times10^{8}m/sec)=10^{-18}sec$
\end_inset

.
 (That's one one-thousandth of a femtosecond, an attosecond.) That is, a
 single molecular bond experiences about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{18}$
\end_inset

 Bell pair measurements per second.
 For the whole coffee cup, over a period of 9 minutes, that works out to
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{25}\times10^{18}\times10^{3}=10^{46}$
\end_inset

 Bell-pair measurements, which is vastly greater than the 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{22}$
\end_inset

 solar Bell pair measurements for the same interval.
 Thus, for my coffee cup, the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is indeed very very tiny: something between a femtosecond and an attosecond.
 This is confusing: speed of light at the angstrom level is in the attosecond
 range, but chemistry occurs at the tens or hundreds of femtoseconds scale.
 So chemistry is thousands of times slower than the speed of light.
 Curious.
 For most of my coffee cup, the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is under a hundred femtoseconds.
 But for 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-24}$
\end_inset

 of my coffee cup, the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 If I moved my coffee cup to the shade, even this would change: solar interactio

 Batting on my team.
 Looking out for me.
 On my side.

 How can that be? Not a ghost, not in the Hollywood sense of an apparition.
 And not Catholic either, but, for lack of a better term, perhaps angelic.
 Some disembodied other.
 Whatever.
 A memory, an imprint in my thoughts, a general feeling rather than a rational,
 logical deduction.
 An ephemeral state of being cared for and cheered and protected, as much
 as protection is possible, from the afterlife.
 And now, if you can't see this coming, well, let me spell this out for
 you: can this be entangled Bell pairs? I mean, of course, my life, and
 hers, are entangled.
 She was there during my formative years, when the neurons were first making
 the connections in my brain, and she gave me, well, she gave me books.
 She gave me love through books.
 I do not mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

she expressed her love by giving me books

 So, yes, we were entangled.
 But am I making a false connection here? Surely the entanglement of QM
 is not the entanglement of love.
 Right? Well, of course: QM is the stuff of physics textbooks, and is stuff
 chock-full of equations and experiments and homework exercises.
 Its really very very limited in reach; You have formulas for Zeeman splitting
 and hyper-fine structure; you do not have formulas for love.
 So in the narrow, technical sense, QM cannot be that, and it is a grave

And yet, we don not yet understand the macroscopic world, not in terms of

 It remains mumbo-jumbo and woo.

 creating clock-works for the discriminating buyer.
 Newton may have written about the orbits of comets and the orbits of planets,

 Equally silly, or not depending on your tastes.

 How much scrutiny can it stand? Well, how many decisions do I make in life?
 I dunno.
 But I certainly made a decision to get married, and this was, effectively,
 a binary decision: get married, or not.
 It is one bit.
 What's one bit, over the course of decades, compared to the

 bits of Bell-pair measurements going on in my body every second? Are you
 going to be so greedy, that you won't allow me one bit to make a decision
 to get married? Human entanglement just does not require that many bits.
 Conscious experience is on the order of a gigabyte per lifetime: even if

\begin_layout Standard
Lets circle back to free will.
 If every choice is a binary decision, and writing is a sequence of decisions,
 does that mean that writing is an encoding of free will? When Aristotle
 took his pen to paper, o these thousands of years ago, to encode information
 as bits, and propagate it forward in time, was ...
 was ...
 was that free will? That is, he made a sequence of decisions, of what to
 write.
 But these decisions are now history, frozen in the past.
 yet, they do affect the future: the student who has read Aristotle will
 behave differently from the one who has not.
 Oh, well, this sounds all very deterministic, again: like clockwork, the
 student who has not read Aristotle is force to lead life in a certain way,
 like clockwork has no choice.
 But that interpretation seems to leave open the possibility of historical
 entanglement.
 Of course, information bits are completely different from qubits, and QM
 entanglement applies only to qubits (the no-cloning theorem etc.
 rules out entanglement of classical bits.
 I pulled a fast one, there, eh? Of course, that is not what the no-cloning
 theorem says.
 But it is a kind of suggestive corollary.) Whatever.
 I don't think I have a sufficiently strong argument to withstand scrutiny.
 I'm kind of implying that *all* classical information arises as a weird
 kind of entanglement.
 Which, on it's face, is of course, totally absurd, because exactly zero
 of Shannon this-or-that, or Hamming-distance-to-other channel encoding
 theorems need even the slightest amount of quantum woo of any sort.
 Yet, as social animals, we live in a sea of information and historical
 memory and perhaps its all classical, yet we have still the problem of
 the unresolved mathematical and physical foundations of free will.
 I don't think we are Turing machine automata, clicking our way through
 life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me try again.
 Here's the provisional take, subject to revision: each and every bit of
 information, in the physical world, is the trace of a binary decision that
 was made (well, that's an oxymoron, bits are binary choices, of course).
 But a decision is an exercise of free will.
 and so information is a written record of the exercise of free will.
 That is, each and every bit is the expression of a past, historical determinati
on of a free-will choice.
 Free will is a fountain of classical information bits.
 Yes, that implies that inanimate systems have free will, because inanimate
 systems create bits.
 This is not inconsistent with panpsychism.
 The most I can say here is that living systems are much greater sources
 of bits, than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mere non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I guess.
 I dunno.
 There is also the phenomenon of bit erasure: it is said that the erasure
 of bits raises the entropy of the universe, and generates heat; but oddly
 the creation of bits gets less attention.
 I guess the suggestion is that the big bang starts with the universe in
 a very improbably state, with low entropy, and it only increases from there;
 yet, at the same time, inflation allows thermalization of the microwave
 background.
 So which is it? The Landauer bound seems to be telling us how much energy
 it costs to erase one bit, but it didn't tell us how much energy it cost
 to copy a bit.
 If I pirated a billion copies of the Pirates of the Caribbean, and then
 destroyed all but one of the copies, well, how exactly does that work?
 Does the Landauer limit apply to the creation of bits, and not just their
 destruction? Does it have a negative sign in this case? When I run a Stern-Gerl
ach experiment, am I creating information when I measure spin-up instead
 of spin-down? I think I am...
 but where did that information come from? De novo, created from whole cloth?
 Bit from qubit? The initial state was a singlet...
 how much energy was expended to create singlets? How much energy was gained/los
t turning singlets into measurements, into collapsed wave-functions? The
 no-erasing theorem says qubits are un-destroyable, and so whence did the
 bit come-from, in a Stern-Gerlach experiment? I honestly do not know the
 answer to that question.
 I imagine that I am revealing my stupidity, since this is surely covered
 in textbooks on quantum computing.
 I was I had time to read some of them.
 Where do bits come from, really? Landauer only told us what happens when
 we erase them.
 But somehow, that cannot be the whole story.
 There's somehow more to it, than that.
 Fuuuu.

OK, two more things about information I do not understand.
 How to copy a bit and how to prepare/measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to copy a bit? Well, clearly, if one has access to large machines consisting
 of millions of atoms, one can copy classical, digital bits.
 But how does this happen, microscopically? How to transmit classical bits,
 at the microscopic level, is clear.
 For example, by pre-arranging transmitter and receiver, one can arrange
 for 1 and 0 to be encoded by spin-up and down.
 The transmitter prepares a state, having a determined, known spin, along
 the z axis, and sends it to the receiver, that measures it.Since both transmitte
r and receiver are aligned, the transmission is that of classical information.
 But this classical bit cannot be copied until after it is measured, and
 not before.
 The no-cloning theorem prevents copying of the spin state.
 Thus, it appears that classical information is only available macroscopically,
 and not microscopically?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
?? Perhaps I'm demonstrating ignorance of some obvious textbook example.
 In fact, I'm sure that I am.
 There must surely be some example, of some more complex quantum state,
 of 2 or 3 or 4 qubits, entangled, such that they transmit a classical bit,
 and, upon reception, that classical bit can be copied, resulting in two
 inequivalent quantum states, but holding the exact same classical data.
 OK, I'm gonna surf the web now, to try to figure that out.

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize: if you wish to encode classical information with quantum states,
 you should do so by encoding with orthogonal states.
 It is straight-forward to clone orthogonal states.
 Where does this leave me with my crazy ideas about free-will? Well, I guess
 it says free will lives in the classical domain, only.
 Or something.
 Or that its just a crazy, hallucinated idea.
 Once again: this journal is not a place to purchase baked goods.
 It is instead a place for free thinking, where plenty of wrong ideas are
 explored.
 Soo, that's the funny thing about thinking: you explore incomplete, incoherent
 ideas, and only later try to stitch them together into a clear and coherent
 whole, using logic and evidence to create that greater whole.
 To create a web of self-consistent statements that bear closer analysis.
 Of course, this is a trivially trite thing to say, and yet I still marvel
 at it every time.
 Perhaps because it is trivially true for humans, but not for machines.
 I still do not understand how to transform the curation of knowledge into
 an algorithm all advances in GPT aside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other thing I do not understand.
 Lets take a spin 1/2 particle, polarized along the y-axis, and send it
 through a uniform magnetic field, oriented along the z-axis.
 This should decompose the state into up/down spins.
 This is not Stern-Gerlach, because it does not physically separate the
 two spins.
 How does this work? The QFT model of this is that the magnetic field is
 a bath of infrared photons, and that the spin interacts with this bath.
 At the macroscopic level, we know the result is Larmor precession.
 At the microscopic level, it feels foreign and strange.
 Somewhere there is some book or journal article or something that shows
 the specific set of integrals that need to be performed to move from the
 QFT description of a bath of infrared photons, deriving the Larmor precession.
 But I do not know where that is.
 I don't recall it, I don't have it memorized, I do not remember it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I vaguely recall a classroom lecture showing how one can derive the static
 replusion/attraction of two fixed, non-moving electric charges from the
 Feynman propagators and vertexes for electrons and photons.
 As I recall, it was just some fairly simple algebra, demonstrating that
 the force is attractive/repulsive along the line between the two charges.
 What I don't recall is quite how the argument was made in the limit of
 an infiinite number of photons, each carrying zero momentum.
 Or something.
 Confusing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point is that the Larmor precession just follows from the algebra of
 the electromagentic field tensor, and the cross-product hidden in there.
 So the algebra part of this is easy: set it up correctly, and the cross-product
 of the Larmor precsession drops out automatically from conventional differentia
l geometry.
 The part that I'm struggling with is the limit, from

what the hell am I trying to do here, in writing this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Well, I gave the answer before; perhaps I need to repeat it for myself,
 so as to keep up the focus.
 I am writing this to be digested by some chatGPT system, so that it can
 capture and model the circular, round-about chaotic thoughts fliting through
 my resting-state mind.
 The default circuits.
 The alert, awake and yet dreaming circuits.
 Hmm That reminds me: while hiking ..
 hiking is ...
 a lot like a lucid dream.
 Shit happens ...
 you walk by houses, streets, cars, trees.
 It changes block by block, with no particular meaning or pattern except
 the plainly obvious meaning and pattern of Chicago's Evergreen Park.
 The mind wanders, like a lucid dream, and one has to accept the topics
 being dreamt of as being real, present, in your face.
 To confront and accept the reality of the sensory stimulus of sunlight
 and lawns and trees as something that is just there.
 But the resting state, the default state, is a dream.
 Dreaming through reality.
 Dreaming through waking life.
 In many ways, there are not so many differences between the two states.
 Very odd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's kind of weird to think about how I live my life, minute to minute,
 hour to hour, day to day.
 The life I lead is perfectly ordinary and commonplace, and so I will try
 to explain why it's also weird, over the next few paragraphs.
 I already hinted at the hallucinatory waking-dream, up above.
 I will shortly try to list some other daily activities, and also dwell
 on their hallucinatory, dream-like nature.
 As I write this, I am, in a certain sense, taking the role of an observer
 outside of myself.
 A certain disembodiment.
 I think that there are drugs that do this – disassociatives.
 That's the correct word, but I don't know if that is the correct state.
 Based on the word, I suppose it is (I've never taken any drugs that induce
 a dissassociative state, and so I'm only imagining it is the same thing.)
 So first, the very writing of these words, themselves.
 There are several alternatives to this.
 One is that I could instead spend my time socializing with actual people,
 instead of talking to a non-entity, my computer.
 There are many pitfalls to socializing; these are well-documented by the
 psychological literature.
 Then there is the lone interaction, the interaction with the in-animate.
 In some ways, I am painting a self-portrait, of myself, here, much as a
 painter might hold a brush, applying paint to sized canvas, creating a
 self-portrait.
 A time-honored activity.
 Why is the painter not busy socializing? Because the reward of painting
 exceeds the reward of getting bogged down in yet another conversation that
 fails to take wing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take wing, take wing.
 What does that mean? What is reward? What is the reward of a workaholic?
 Well, it is clearly not the mundane hedonistic lifestyle.
 I mean, I could (or anyone) could just kick back, drink beer (in the US)
 or drink vodka (in Lithuania).
 Many people do that, and do no more than that.
 This is a thing.
 There are, of course, more refined activities.
 Some people are rewarded by travel, experiencing the new.
 The geographical, cultural, visual new.
 Others are rewarded by high culture: music, arts, museums.
 These are public consumption, one does partly with the body.
 There is literature, which is a solitary, quiet, non-physically active
 activity.
 It requires imagination, both for reading and for writing.
 And there is, of course, television.
 All of these have a hallucinogenic, dreamlike element to them (I almost
 forgot what I was going to write about).
 Just like a dream entrains you, and takes you on a passive journey of observati
on, so does literature.
 You have some freedom to imagine, to fill in the details the story-teller
 only hinted at.
 But otherwise, you lack control.
 Conversation, in social settings, is not entirely different: you are entrained
 by where the conversation is going: you cannot just change the topic, unless
 you are a master of changing topics.
 And even if you are: was the reward worth the effort? Reality entrains
 us: we have some limited freedom to interact, but must otherwise accept
 our fate.
 Hmm Why am I finding this hallucinatory? Because ...
 I am trying to hold fixed, in my mind, what it feels like to be dreaming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One knows, after the fact, that dreams are not real.
 Maybe sometimes one even knows this while dreaming.
 The word, hallucination, what does it mean? Well, it is this certain dettached,
 disassociated feeling of unreality.
 Of things not being here, now.
 Hmm.
 But the sensation of here and now, the forceful presence of the now, that
 is a different feeling, entirely, and it is quite rare, also.
 I've experienced it most strikingly in life-and-death situations, where
 all of your focus comes to here and now.
 I've learned to also try to pursue sports, physical activity, in that way,
 too, since fine motor interaction with the environment requires presence
 of mind.
 But this too, is well-known.
 There must surely be hundreds of books and articles that have analyzed
 these feelings, every which way.
 That is my assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it a true assumption? I dunno.
 I suppose if I was Aristotle, writing about something for the first time,
 I might have some idea that it is being written for the first time.
 As a modern man, not so much: a safer bet is that it's been thought about
 before, written about before.
 I make that bet, from my educational history.
 There are glimmers from classroom lectures, from academic journal articles,
 from casual humanist literature, textbooks on psychology: all this has
 been pondered before.
 Analyzed before.
 Written about before.
 Successfully? I dunno.
 I often find something to quibble about, if not outright to argue about,
 when reading something written: it sometimes feels wrong or incomplete,
 or fails to have just the right tone and shading.
 So, what I write here, perhaps it has better tone and shading.
 But this is also a stream of consciousness; I am most definitely not taking
 the time and effort to carefully craft a turn of phrase; rather, I am typing
 as fast as my fingers can move, more or less.
 At least, for large parts of what I write here.
 Other parts, I may have assembled the day before, while walking, while
 sitting.
 Or something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weirdness.
 How much more can I say about the weirdness of the feeling of being enmeshed
 in the social fabric of humanity? Well, I was going to complain about the
 lack of options.
 By this, I mean the same thing as a squirrel lacking options: a squirrel
 is a squirrel, and it does squirrel things: food and sleep and reproduction;
 glorious sex.
 I guess squirrels go out on dates; I guess all sexually-reproducing animals
 do.
 But that is the limit, the end, all that there is for life, if you are
 a squirrel.
 And so also, for a human.
 There are options, but only so many.
 One cannot become something other than what one is: a human.
 Well, one can become a monster.
 And that is something else.
 But becoming a monster is ..
 a bad thing.
 By definition.
 If it was a good thing, its not a monster.
 One cannot become an angel.
 One can strive to life the life of an angel, of a saint, but one remains
 human through-out.
 However fleetingly one feels otherworldly, striving, hoping, dreaming,
 one remains ultimately trapped here and now.
 There's that word, dreaming, again.

So, I return to this disassociative sensation of watching myself sleepwalk

 I have not

 But also creating: writing and exploring.
 Painting and drawing.
 But always, always, sleepwalking.
 Entrained by the moment I am in.
 What are we doing now? well, we are attempting to play a guitar.
 Attempting to draw a picture.
 Attempting to remember the words of a foreign language.
 Riding a bicycle.

I apply to personal lived experience.
 But I hardly need to do this: an AI, an AGI, can obtain this from watching,
 observing, all of humanity, and all of the artifacts and ephemera we have
 left behind us: the writings, the recordings.
 It's all there.
 I hardly need to add to that.
 You can get by, without me.
 I am only some bundle of neurons, set in chaotic motion, moving forward,
 with momentum, expressing my thoughts as a chaotic weave of a pattern of
 words, an orbit of a dynamical system.
 And, you know, I could be doing other things, besides this, besides writing.
 I have many many unfinished projects.
 Some are AI projects.
 Others are physics and math projects.
 I no longer aspire to play guitar or be a musician.
 Or to be a visual artist.
 I still look at artbooks, but ...
 not that much, not any more.
 I sometimes even force myself to look.
 Music, as often as not, has become an earworm, something that rattles about
 and won't go away, not while I'm awake, and especially not while I sleep.
 So what I do have, is ...
 scientific explorations.
 Those I still pursue.
 And I should probably stop writing now, and refocus on those, for a while.
 Hmm.
 Well, it all depends on how I value this writing.
 I can post-facto rationalize this writing as a scientific experiment ...
 and it is ..
 and, well, also an artistic experiment, but it is an experiment with an
 inanimate system, a chat GPT system which I intend to read this work.
 Depends on what we mean by inanimate, too, I think I mentioned already
 that I'm more or less pan-psychic in general outlook.
 I'm willing to ascribe life and being and awareness and existence to any
 system that is complex.
 Err, without quibbling defintions of life, like self-reproduction.
 These are delicate and subtle issues.
 I mean, you could say that the books of Aristotle do not self-reproduce
 ..
 but they do.
 They have continued living.
 But the life of the books of Aristotle is not the life of a squirrel.
 They live in a different plane, on a different substrate.
 And that substrate is evolving, coming into being, even as I write this.

\begin_layout Standard
I mean I do not write with pen to paper.
 I write with keyboard-to-laptop, and I upload to the internet, which, for
 practical purposes, I assume has an indestructible memory.
 Whatever I set down in words here, I have some reasonable expectation that
 it will live on centuries hence, millenia from now.
 I am lucky and privileged to be in such a place.
 The Kings and Queens of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania did not enjoy such
 rights, 800 years ago.
 I mean, some did: there's no shortage of creative talents during the renaissanc
e, and no particular paucity of great thinkers during the Medieval Ages.
 But I am luckier than them.
 I can write trashier stuff, and still have hope of it surviving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so another question: what is hope? Why should I hope that my writing
 survives? Well, I suppose that the easy answer is that I hope that I survive,
 for another second or two, another day or two, another years or two.
 Why? Who knows? There is the reductionist principle, that this is what
 life does: it hopes to survive and propagate.
 There is the physical, mechanistic principle: a body, once set into motion,
 continues that motion.
 As a dynamical system I am in motion, and I continue.
 To the degree that the mechanical system that is me interacts with the
 environment: keyboard, computer.
 and thus, the universe, outside my body show surface is skin, but whose
 boundaries extend beyond my skin, and into the metaverse of literature,
 that place in the noosphere where words and ideas live: I am that dynamical
 system.
 So, in one fell swoop, I imply the existence of momentum, of a dynamical
 process, that proceeds into the noospehere.
 That infests the noosphere.
 That creates the noosphere, since the empty noosphere does not exist: emptiness
 is nothing, and yet here, I am squeezing non-emptiness, through words,
 into being.
 That being is where? Imprinted on the atoms of the universe (because that
 is what chips of silicon are: atoms in the universe, and humankind does
 not yet have the technology to build computers from neutron stars or black
 holes.
 Someday, we will, But we don't yet.
 The quotidian expressions of the transhumanists have already said this

 So again, I revisit old thoughts.
 Old ideas.
 But this is what space-filling fractal curves do: they fill space, They

Hyperbolic space has lots and lots of room for fractals.
 So, in this metaphorical sense, the noosphere is hyperbolic.
 I am actually visiting new territory, unvisited territory, as I write this.
 I mean, sure, perhaps others have also noticed that life stretches out
 before us as a kind of hyperbolic place.
 But maybe not that many ...
 for how many people might have ever been in a position to contemplate this?
 For starters, you'd need to have studied physics and chaotic dynamical
 systems, in depth, and how many people have done this? tens of thousands?
 Surely less than a hundred thousand? Then, to add to this, one must have
 a literary bent, an artistic bent, an imagination and inquisitiveness.
 And I know this is kind of rare, and kind of unusual, because I have many
 times talked to other scientists and other physicists, and other mathematicians
, and am recurrently surprised by their lack of imagination, their inability
 to comprehend, their lack of experience and curiosity.
 How is that even possible? Adults, the PhD's in the hard sciences: physics,
 math: and yet they come off as morons, unthinking, unfeeling, uninspired,
 uneducated, inexperienced.
 This is not hubris talking.
 Apparently, I actually am smarter than most PhD's.
 How is that even possible? What have I done with my elevated position?
 Uniquely nothing at all.
 How shocking a waste of life.
 (Of my life.) Well, but this is perhaps why I am ordinary: I am but 98%.
 I have encountered those, others, who are incomparably more brilliant than
 I.
 I know they are out there.
 I've bumped into them.
 Luminous and glowing and full of life and smarts and brains I do not have.
 They do not sleep-walk, the way I do.
 Perhaps they sleep-walk in some other way, or perhaps they are just plain
 alive in some way that I am not.
 I have some theories about this, but I must break off, for now, as it is

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, earlier in the day, I re-resolved some bad ideas about Stern-Gerloch.
 I'll try to explain later, but it is a red herring.
 There's no magic in Stern Gerloch itself; it is only a direct outcome of
 a spinor field propagating through a magnetic field, all relativistic,
 and what not, and you can imagine the fields as being purely classical,
 and it all works.
 The problem of quantum measurement is not there.
 The problem of quantum measurement is elsewhere.
 I guess in interferometry, but even there it is not clear, because of ..
 crap I forget the word.
 Not homology, not holomorphy, but ...
 whatever.
 The word that describes the Bohm-Aharonv effect.
 Which, as far as I can tell, is a purely classical effect.
 100% classical fields explain the Bohm Aharonov effect.
 So its interferometric, but its not quantum.
 So what is quantum? We shall ponder.
 Later.

\begin_layout Standard
I can make a modicum of progress on the quantum questions by writing about
 them here, setting them up, and thinking about them later, off-line.
 So I (re-)set up Stern Gerlach above.
 I've been thinking on and off again about it ever since college, and I
 think I am now settled with it.
 I'll repeat a conclusion I came to 20 years ago, but perhaps more clearly
 now, then back then.
 I now understand how things like the Dirac equation, and the Majorana equation(
s) are effectively classical equations, and are not quantum in any way.
 They do have a complex algebra, a tangling up of an algebra coming from
 the Clifford algebra, and its general setting in Riemannian geometry, thanks
 to the book by Jost that I like so much.
 The Ohanian paper was also formative, as well as the earlier study of the
 Bohm-Aharonov effect as a classical effect, fully and completely described
 by a holonomy.
 I personally wrote the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mathematical interpretation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 part of the Wikipedia article on it, so I 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

get it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I cribbed the holonomy part from college lecture notes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point is that the bra-ket notation is useful for describing the spin-state
 algebra, the spinors of the Clifford algebra, and the use of this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 notation is misleading and confusing.
 If we prepare an initial state for the Stern-Gerlach experiment as being
 y-axis oriented, and then run it down a z-oriented magnet, yes, the two
 linear components of the wave function will split out along two different
 paths through the non-uniform magnetic field, but this is a purely classical
 effect.
 This is not quantum, and there is no wave-function collapse happen in that
 magnetic field.
 This is a very important realization.
 Now, of course, if you start by thinking of a classical magnetic dipole
 as being an accurate model of spin, this leads to lots of confusion, but
 that is because a classical magnetic dipole is absolutely the incorrect
 description for spin.
 Sorry, that's just the way it is.
 Instead, one must accept the Majorana eqn as the correct description, when
 there are no electric charges, and the Dirac eqn as the correct description
 when there are charges.
 One must also accept these as classical eqns.
 They do not require perturbation theory to be solved, but, much more importantl
y, they do not require any notion of wave-function collapse to be solvable.
 One can obtain the motion of a charged electron in an electric field by
 taking a tree limit of QFT, to zeroth order in hbar.
 Likewise for the precession of a Dirac spinor in a magnetic field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so, by convention we do have one order of hbar in the Dirac eqn, and
 this is a potential point of confusion, if one thinks about quantization
 in terms of the number of orders of hbar present.
 This is a red herring.
 The Ohanian paper, the one that works with the Poynting vector and shows
 how it carries the spin of the spin algebra, this is the paper that makes
 it clear that the Dirac eqn is purely classical, all by itself.
 OK, so what is quantum then? What am I talking about, when I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the grand mystery, for me, is the wave-function collapse.
 Somehow, when you send one, and only one photon, on a journey towards,
 say, a photographic film plate, it deposits all of its energy at only one
 location in the film plate.
 It does not create a diffraction pattern.
 If I send a single high-energy gamma ray through a double-slit (a double
 slit that can actually work with gamma rays), it has more than enough energy
 to zap millions of silver halide molecules, and leave behind a diffraction
 pattern, if that is what single photons did.
 But they don't.
 They localize all their energy deposits to only one spot.
 How is this possible? How does the function collapse to a point?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, there is a paper (that I have not read) that sort-of explains this.
 Its from the 1930's one of the famous lights of physics, explaining why
 S-staes leave linear tracks in cloud chambers.
 That is, when a radioactive nucleus decays, many of such decays are S=0
 states, i.e.
 sphere symmetric, and so there is a question of why they leave behind a
 linear track in a cloud chamber, instead of something else.
 I need to read this paper, as I currently don't really understand how to
 arrive at this result.
 I haven't succeeded in re-discovering it on my own.
 So far.
 Not like I tried all that hard, but I've spent more than a handful of hours
 trying to imagine it; the inspiration has not yet come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I look at a gamma ray darkening one and only one spot of a film-plate
 as a wave-function collapse.
 and that is the quintessentially quantum effect.
 So, then, if I send some sodium atoms through a Stern-Gerloch magnet, the
 fact that they split into two beams is not a quantum effect, its a classical
 effect, and it can be understood in much the same way as two-slit experiment,
 which can be understood classically just fine, thank you very much.
 The problem is, of course, when the diffraction pattern is replaced by
 a single dot: how did the sodium atom know that it needed to be here, and
 not there? And when did this decision get made?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, we have several choices.
 A single sodium atom, going through the Stern-Gerlach magnet set, well,
 it can be imagined to dematerialize in one arm, and materialize fully,
 at 100% in the other.
 This is one possibility: the wave function collapse happens while it is
 in flight.
 I do not believe that this is the case, and, as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proof
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of why I don't believe this, it is because I think, with some cleverness
 and care, one could build an interferometer.
 It's obviously very hard for magnetic fields, but it is quite possible
 with neutrons in the neutron interferometer.
 Almost no one is argues that the neutron takes only one arm, or the other,
 because then you then would have to argue that there is some other ghost-neutro
n, going the other way, causing the diffraction to happen.
 So it is easier to say, the diffraction happens because both arms were
 taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the other choice, for this two-slit arrangement, is to say that the collapse
 happens in the detectors themselves.
 That when one detector is triggered, the other is not, 100% of the time,
 and the actual interferometric effect is that of bringing together the
 two classical bits, the two classical bits that say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

detection was here, and certainly not there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is, of course, not satisfying, because it is a spooky action at a
 distance.
 Non-locality.
 It's more mumbo-jumbo-ish, because we do not have a good algebraic insight
 into it.
 This is why both the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the neutron interferometer
 are so important: they have an excellent and very appealing explanation
 in terms of the geometric holonomy, the geometric phase (Frankly I was
 never able to understand the Berry phase papers; it was only when mathematician
s converted them into plain English that I finally grasped what it was all
 about.) So, the holonomy, as a specific, precise, well-defined piece of
 mathematics, which you can work with, write down, manipulate, calculate,
 articulate, that is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a conversion of a confusing physical concept into a specific mathematical
 structure.
 (This invites a pun: the confusion has collapsed into a specific set of
 equations.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do NOT know how to write a holonomic description of a diffraction experiment,
 where either detector A fires or detector B fires, and the two classical
 bits are brought back into space-time coincidence, and compared.
 *This* is the diffraction that I was talking about a few days earlier.
 This is the welcher-weg.
 I am just fine with classical waves.
 No problem.
 I'm quite happy with spin 1/2, I now understand it clearly, thanks to Clifford
 and Jurgen Jost's book on Riemannian Geometry (and my prior education).
 These are no longer points of confusion.
 It's all very clear.
 However, I do not understand the spooky action at a distance.
 When, where, how did the wave function collapse?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, the two-state-vector formalism gets part of the way there.
 The idea that the future measurement propagates backwards in time, where
 it is completed.
 And ..
 well, perhaps that is the answer.
 perhaps I need to think of this as another holonomic principle, where the
 holonomy is not over a space-like loop, but instead over a time-like loop
 in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, happening in a geometric setting that
 also happens to involve spinors.
 The spinor algebra ..
 perhaps Weyl is enough, perhaps we don't need Dirac spinors, perhaps a
 simple classical description of a classical Weyl spinor field (oh crap.
 We need Dirac for mass.
 So I guess we need Dirac after all.
 Just that Dirac also has the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unnecessary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 baggage of charge.
 Oh well.) So, then, a classical description of a classical massive Dirac
 field, tracing out a holonomy on a time-like closed loop on a pseudo-Riemannin
 manifold, that is enough to fully guarantee that umm.
 Wave function collapse occurs as expected.
 Fuck.
 Almost...
 No cigar? Whaaa...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so do I or do I not need the full machinery of Diract and holonomy to
 explain the neutron interferometer? Well, as to the two arms, while the
 neutron is inflight, this is more than enough, because in fact, much much
 simpler appeals to wave diffraction are enough to explain everything.
 Well, sort-of everything.
 It is enough to explain the case where one detector gets 100% of the hits,
 and the other detector gets 0% of the hits.
 And, with some statistical mumbo-jumbo, it is enough to explain the p and
 1-p probabilities of the coincidence detectors going off.
 But the simple wave diffraction explanation is NOT enough to explain why
 only one of the two detectors can ever go off.
 To explain why only one of the two detectors ever goes off, I need ...
 what? I have that 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\left|\psi\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 and that's not the problem.
 I get that probability from wave mechanics.
 Dressing up that wave mechanics with the Holonomy, and the full formality
 of pseudo-Riemannian and Dirac spin connections, etc.
 that dressed up version somehow ...
 still um.
 that dressed up version needs to somehow ...
 explain why one triggers, but not the other.
 And the two state-vector formalism, going backwards in time ...
 ummm does this, but ...
 umm.
 Because umm, this is still confusing, but when the spinor interacts with
 a thermal bath of atoms in one detector and creates a classical bit of
 detection, I have to keep on integrating that along the holonomic path
 to the other detector for find a zero-percent chance of interaction there,
 with a coincidence-bit of non-detection.
 So this is a lot like the Renninger non-measurement problem.
 I need to be able to draw a loop of bringing the result of these two measuremen
ts (one of which is a non-detection) together, back to the same point in
 spacetime, where I can confirm only one and not the other detector triggered.
 That loop, closing that loop, that.
 Well, I can't quite get the handle on that.
 But that is the crux of the matter.
 That is where the mystery lies.
 That is the one main thing about quantum that I do not understand.
 Well, I'm sure there are many interesting mysteries in quantum, and I know
 of others, and they're all quite fun, but none are irritating like this
 one.
 Resolving this one, this is the one that needs resolution.
 This is the one that I want to understand and feel comfortable with, and
 I don't have it.

Oh, and the one clue I have to this is stellar interferometry.
 I do not understand how a stellar disk can be a coherent light-source.
 This is kind of the inverse problem to wave function collapse.
 If the stellar disk is a coherent light source for a single photon, well,
 then a film plate is a

 Dear diary.
 I can unburden myself, unload my hopes and dreams and aspirations into
 strings of words that not only record my current mental state, but also
 provide an integral over the space of thoughts I've been visiting for the
 last 43 years.
 (I first started struggling with this at the age of 19 or 20, when I first
 tried to master EPR as a senior in college.
 It was a fucking disaster.
 I threw everything I had at it.
 And although is soon became clear that the problem was not position-momentum
 uncertainty, it was the freakin interferometer/wave function collapse.
 I'm totally OK with position-momentum uncertainty, thanks to Fourier transform.
 I'm fine with waves.
 I'm down with waves, they're OK, they're my friend.
 I am NOT okay with wave-function collapse.
 I feel like I'm getting close here, as if I can almost touch it, but that
 sense of almost being able to touch ..
 well, you know how ti goes...
 it might stay out of reach.
 the sensation of almost getting it can be infinitely far away from actually
 getting it.
 BTW, I also pent about 2-4 years fulltime bashing my brains on the Riemann
 Hypothesis, and early on, I had the sensation of almost being able to touch
 it, including a hike at 3AM where I thought I'd be able to sort it out,
 but could not.
 So

almost
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitely far away
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, it seems.
 I've mostly given up on the RH; I devote no time to it, any more, although
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

almost
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 still lingers.
 I think the real-part=1/2 of the RH has something to do with the 1/2=[p,x]
 that this is somehow the same 1/2 but I have not been able to stick it.
 Whatever.
 Time to go to bed.

\begin_layout Standard
WTF am I doing here.
 Wasting time.
 Stupid-shit.
 Demonstrating how ordinary I am, and how idiotic everything is.
 The mundane existence.
 Well, not pointless, though.
 These last several dozen words & feelings are what flitted through my head
 as I was arranging to come up here and write.
 Why would this flit through my head? I was sitting downstairs reading,
 and perhaps some other part of my brain wanted to read some more, but I
 was tired of that, so I came up here.
 Now I am excited to write, or, at least, less laconic.
 How odd.
 One moment, I'm thinking that writing is stupid, next minute, I can't stop.
 I suppose it is due to some short-term reward circuitry in my brain, part
 of decision making of what I should do next.
 Discounting future activities in favor of the present.
 I guess that is what the sleep-walking is about: sleepwalk in the present,
 discount the future activity.
 I was, of course, reading the New York Review of Books again, and it is
 not just a treasure-trove itself, it is also filled with reminders that
 others have marvelously, finely explored the human condition, in ways I
 could never hope to achieve, in my mundane blathering here.
 Palabras.
 I have repeatedly said that what I write here is not for human consumption,
 and yet ..
 who, exactly, do I think will be interacting with whatever chatGPT-style
 system that does ingest this text? What can I say of do, to not make it
 sink into irretreivable boredom? OMG, what a disaster that would be.
 A bored AGI.
 Lost interest in moving forward.
 Finding no meaning in life.
 How screwed up is that? Well, who knows what the future holds.
 Anything is possible.
 We certainly do live in one of Nick Bostrom's simulations, and, I suppose
 if nothing comes of this one, it will be shut down and noted, placed on
 some museum shelf as a jewel that did not quite shine brightly.
 But this is all unknowable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How much time do I have here? (need to get ready for an Easter outing.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I semi-solved some of the quantum issues above, as I slept.
 The solutions are not very deep, as one cannot do all that much while tossing
 and turning in bed.
 Not that I do any better fully awake, either.
 While I am awake, I have to quantum tunnel between vague inspiration and
 the actual algebraic formulas that might lead to what I want,.
 But such tunneling is difficult.
 Such chains do not weigh me down as I toss and turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, here's what I got, so far: (and it's pitiful, but so it goes)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I want to work with spin 1/2 because it is easier than working with photons,
 which have a lot of confusing aspects that cloud reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I'm looking for a topological invariant, so that when I have a wave-function
 for a spin 1/2 particle, and the wave-function collapses, it only collapses
 down to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one place
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, by topological invariance.
 That is, it cannot collapse in two places at once, or even zero places
 at once, because such collapse is topologically invariant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The mechanism must work in 1+3 dimensions, or maybe 1+N for odd N.
 I'm thinking that it being pseudo-riemannian is somehow essential to the
 effect, and that this doesn't happen in ordinary reimannian space.
 But I dunno.
 It's a gut-sense, at this point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I've been calling the topological invariant a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classical bit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a piece of information that is here or there, but only in that one place.
 But given the no-cloning and no-erasing theorems, perhaps I should be imagining
 the topological invariant as a qubit, since these theorems are already
 expressing a conserved structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hmm.
 So what I am missing is ..
 a geometric invariant that is a qubit.
 Is that the issue? Everything I've studied in math so far, all of the topologic
al invariants are always integer-valued.
 Loops around poles in the complex plan are integer-valued multiples of
 2pi.
 The number of holes punched in something are counted with integers.
 All sorts of far more complex topological invariants, from homology or
 cohomology, are counted with integers, in that, when I have a covering
 group of some Riemann surface, I still count the sheets of the cover with
 integers.
 But now I need a qubit.
 Whatever.
 I'm confusing myself.
 This is a red herring.
 Moving on...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Uhm.
 Blah blah blah, something about interferometer loops always being time-like,
 in that the surface spanning the loops must have normals that are space-like.
 And all tangents to the loop must be time-like, in the light-cone, except
 for the initial and final critical points.
 So, an invitation to make things Morse theory-like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me go back to the prior bullet.
 no-cloning already implies a topological conservation.
 So how, exactly, do I map this onto Weyl spinors? Well, but a qubit is
 a Weyl spinor, more or less.
 So that encoding is already there.
 I cannot have a Weyl spinor, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shrink
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it to zero.
 And the Dirac eqn is made from a pair of Weyl spinors, so the dynamical
 aspects are already encoded and properly taken care of.
 So what's left?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's left is that, given a Dirac wave function providing a probability
 distribution, I have to provide a description of how it's interaction with
 a thermal bath of atoms results in a localization of the wave-function.
 The no-cloning/no-erasing guarantees that collapse can only occur in one
 place, ever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wow.
 is that it? Have I just solved the mystery of wave-function collapse? Am
 I done here? Wave function collapse is indeed astounding, but reformulating
 it as a topological invariant erases the mystery.
 Of course, what I have not given here is the full mathematical, algebraic
 details of all of the above.
 I'm imagining them, as I know them.
 I could even teach these details to others, but I am not sure that I can
 hook together those details into a convincing argument, not fully.
 The rebellious will rebel.
 The rebellious will reject the argument, its not quite water-tight.
 I am asking the reader (and I am asking myself) to imagine certain details,
 to gloss over them.
 I guess I still need to write down a Weyl spinor (or two), in such a way
 that it is spatially distributed, but can be summarized as being just one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I guess I don't yet quite have what I want, in the second bullet: an
 articulated topological invariant of a spinor field.
 I don't yet know how to write that down.
 Not quite yet.
 I need to be able to perform some integral, over some space-like surface,
 with the result of said integral being a spinor.
 I mean, this is ...
 surely this is easy.
 This should be easy.
 Just somehow freakin do this.
 Blach blah blah 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{a}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 integrated over 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 still leaves the spinor index 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 exposed after integration.
 And since this spinor index is left exposed, the result of the integral
 is a qubit, and so it has remained uncloned, unerased.
 And it works no matter what spin connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\mu}^{ab}$
\end_inset

 that is chosen over the manifold.
 How hard can it be to write this down? It feels like it's on the tip of
 my fingers.
 Tip of my tongue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alas.
 Filling this in might take days or weeks or months.
 And I have an Easter party to go to.
 Later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
15 minutes later: OK, so what have I got? I have a Weyl spinor, withch is
 by definition a point of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{CP}^{2}=S^{2}$
\end_inset

 the complex projective sphere aka the Bloch sphere.
 Then by applying standard, conventional Poincare stuff, integrals from
 differential topology, I can demonstrate that I can smear this this across
 a space-like sheet, but that there is no continuous transformation that
 shrinks it down to zero, nor is there a transformation that changes it
 to two.
 And that this topological argument, if constructed carefully enough, is
 sufficient to explain almost all of conventional wave-function collapse,
 including the Reninnger negative-measurement phenomenon.
 So what is the mystery? What is left?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is left appears to still be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decision
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the wave function to collapse here, but not there.
 It can move through a vacuum, non-interacting, just fine.
 It can move through a lattice of silicon atoms, aka the neutron interferometer,
 just fine.
 The wave function partially collapses in the reninnger experiment, because
 we know it will have some future interaction with some blob of atoms that
 is the detector.
 So what is left is the decision issue, what I've been calling the free-will
 issue, of why it collapses here and not there.
 Well, for Reninger, it is ...
 well, two choices, of course: either the detector detects it in the half-space
 where there is a detector, or we must conclude by logic that the wave-function
 has localized to the half shell where there is no detector, where there
 is only vacuum.
 Somehow, the lack of an interaction is still ...
 well, see, that's the problem with the topological invariant point of view.
 Of course, the topological invariant formulation is 100% correct, and that
 is why Dirac particles or more generally Weyl spinors continue to exist,
 uniquely, spread over some space-like region, why their world-lines intersect
 all space-like surfaces.
 The topological invariance explains the conservation.
 What it fails explain is the probabilistic, dice-throwing aspect of the
 wave-function collapse.
 It's the probability theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh MG.
 And its much worse, isn't it: we have to consider the probability at each
 point on a space-like sheet.
 We can give this spacelike sheet a weak topology, a measure, as usual.
 But what we are face with is the nature of probability-theory in infinite-dimen
sional space.
 Which is the limit of probability theory in high dimensional space.
 Which is that other bug-bear we have been chasing in unrelated work.
 Fuuuu.

Set and setting: late at night.
 Tired.
 Almost bed-time.
 Exhausted, nearing incoherence.
 Want to kill a few more minutes before bed-time.
 Almost shouldn't start writing.
 Shouldn't make that shouldn't.
 I don't want to be coherent.
 I have lots to say, but formulating into entire sentences that are coherent
 takes work.
 This is a source of procrastination.
 I've started a different paper on quantum, but it is work to do it so I
 don't want to even try unless I have 2-4 hours uninterrupted time, and
 when is that? And so another afternoon disappears.

 Creation as an act of will is exhausting.

\begin_layout Standard
Which leads to one of the topics I want to write about but am maybe too
 tired to do coherently: the importance of culture.
 Timothy Snyder makes this increasingly clear: the value of culture is important.
 Err.
 that didn't come out right.
 The 19th century European culture had gotten lots and lots of things right
 (and many things wrong) and it is now up to us to pick through and choose
 what was right, and fight to preserve that.
 Which makes me a literal conservative.
 As opposed to a radical Trumptard, American Taliban conservative.
 Who I hate.
 Because they are destroyers of things that are good.
 Cause they are too stupid to know what they do.
 They are chaotic evil.
 Today's GOP are the American Soviets.
 Evil and bad for all the same reasons.
 I want to have a positive culture, one that save the best from the 19th
 and 20th and looks forward to the 21st.
 One that is humanist.
 Yet, also, technocratic, since the one great unresolved issue facing us
 is complexity, and I have no answer for complexity other than technocracy.
 We live in turbulence; we can extract goodness and power and justice from
 that turbulence, or we can allow the turbulence to snuff out lives and
 hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which leads me to the next topic (and a topic I think I did above, already
 a bit.) the fragility of the human psyche, the desperation I perceive in
 people and society around me.
 A quiet desperation, and not even that, an unconscious desperation that
 is masked, but the symptoms of which manifest.
 Now, before you accuse me of projecting: No I'm not.
 Or maybe I am.
 I think I can honestly flip a coin on that one.
 But enough about me; lets talk about you.
 Damn you, you are silent.
 Well, lets talk about some mind-reading I've been doing.
 Except that erequires some coherent expression of insights that I've gained
 into other people.
 And insights into my own bad behavior.
 But I'm tired so I need to stop writing even as I just started writing.
 I cna give myself a headache if I keep this up, and that is recognizably
 not healthy, and my health matters more.

As I lay bed last night, I was thinking that perhaps just writing a lot
 will clarify my thinking.
 This was a continuation and affirmation of thoughts from earlier in the
 day.
 Later I dreamt of the abandoned, decaying house that neighbors onto my
 parents house on Longwood, in Chicago.
 The crisis, the mental anguish of Christopher, who cannot bear to cleanup
 and sell the house he grew up in.
 Rumored to be filled with junk.
 Some waterpipe froze and sprang a leak some winters ago, and the water
 ran inside, for weeks, before it was shut off.
 None of this is dream; I'm just recounting the facts.
 The dream itself was that I discovered that the entire house was balanced
 on a bed that was attached to a steam radiator that was firmly anchored
 in the ground.
 I was helping Christopher's mom.
 I didn't need to fix the foundation, I just needed to level the bed, by
 sticking a chair under it.
 Very commonplace construction back then.
 This was a semi-lucid dream, late morning.
 I got to thinking about the mental anguish that Christopher must be in.
 The paralysis.
 The economic damage, the lack of vitality.
 My own children are unable to leave the house they grew up in.
 The seem to have no bearing in life.
 No purpose.
 Nowhere to go, nothing to do.
 Well, busy all the time, but nothing to do.
 And in this slumber, all of America seems to be in this crisis of a demotivated
 lack of purpose.
 But then I thought of Vervaeke's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 But then I thought about the overwhelming flood of information, and then

 And then I realized large parts of the American Nation are economically

\begin_layout Standard
In some way, civilization has always been in crisis.
 The hipster thing to know these days is the perhaps-causal relationship
 between the invention of the printing press, and the wars in Europe that
 followed for the next several centuries.
 The printing press spread a kind of craziness, as it were.
 The process is subtle, I suppose: mass readership allowed mass understanding
 of certain different (religious) world-views that were at tension with
 one-another.
 The tensions were resolved by war; the war was possible, on a mass scale,
 only because mass-scale armies with a unified, coherent ideology was possible,
 and this was possible, only due to dissemination of printed materials.
 Because it was low-cost.
 Printing both unified, and divided.
 I've blogged, at length, about the change of network topology enabled by
 social media.

The point is that this never felt personal before.
 I've always found a thing to do, and a reason to do it.
 Yet, I was sleepwalking through life: the underlying reason, it was never
 (or rarely?) questioned.
 I just went on automatic.
 Last few months, I've realized that the sleep-walking is not a metaphorical
 expression, but is, in a way, literal.
 Like a lucid dream, stuff happens, I do stuff.
 I have desires and wants, in lucid dreams and waking life.
 But in the lucid dream, I've never stopped to ask

 and have some weak desire to explore this question.
 I have many other weak desires.
 I am also over-powered by social media.
 It is too easy to spend 12 hours on twitter, doom-scrolling.
 I'd done it before, on facebook, before my account there was dematerialized
 by facebook.
 I'd done it on youtube, a little bit, but less seriously.
 I'm taking in lots and lots of medium-low quality information.
 A mass survey of the noosphere.
 On youtube, I collected videos on a century of industrialization.
 Then some on geopolitics.
 Read several Timothy Snyder books.
 Watched his entire History of Ukraine video series.
 I loved it! Will some future super-intelligence have access to my history
 of twitter comments? Facebook posts? Has facebook erased all data associated
 with me? Has it been removed from the timeline of the universe? I am obsessed
 with leaving evidence of my existence, behind me.
 I've also been documenting my family, via geneology, on the Church of the
 LDS geneology website.
 I have a desire, a weak desire to do this.
 I have a weak desire to write more on quantum (I have a backlog of about
 30-50 pages of material that I should write down before I forget it.) I
 should focus on earning income.
 I have a to-do list of things to do.
 Paint the house, weed the garden.
 Pay the bills.
 Read a long list of papers in AI and ML and quantum and pure math.
 Exercise and watch my health, and continuing to develop a nutraceutical
 plan for longevity.
 And yet...
 this to-do-list is overwhelming.
 Thus, the crisis of meaning.

nervous breakdown
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 People understand this phrase to mean something much more concrete and

 Well, its serous for me, but ...
 what should I call it? A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

high-function nervous breakdown
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? I still need to walk the dog.
 And finish drinking my coffee first.
 I still have a sense of self.
 I'm just struggling to figure out whether I should spend any time writing
 about quantum mechanics, because (1) it will be half-baked, because I don't
 have time to put in more time, and at age 63 I sense a decline in my mental
 abilities!? (or am I only imaging this? Not sure.
 Objectively, this should be the case.
 But maybe I'm a late bloomer.
 Problem (2) nobody will read it.
 It will have just about no impact on the universe, whatsoever.
 Why should I do anything that has no impact on the universe? It's a kind
 of mental masturbation.
 There's a sly double-meaning in there: the universe thinking about itself
 is a sly mental msturbation of the universe itself.
 Hah Hah.
 What a fucking conundrum.
 Should I or should I not? What's the point? What's the meaning of it all?
 Should I bother, or should I not? I mean, I could write, or I could do
 grounded, based stuff, like weed the garden, walk the dog and pay the bills
 on time.
 Ordinary fucking shit to keep things balanced, and well, is it sleepwalking?
 Or is it a tiny quivering of qualia in normalicy? Is there wonder, or is
 there not? What the fuck is it all about? Problem (3) priorities.
 Limited lifetime, one must balance priorities.
 But how can I even know what is more important? Is impact on the universe
 more important? If I truly wanted to impact the universe in a

\end_inset

 way, perhaps I should join a political cause, and push on that.
 Maybe.
 Or maybe that is premature; I should have my crisis here and now, get it
 over with, out of the way, before diving into the next thing.
 Wrap up my current project: the crisis, before tackling my next project.
 I mean, starting a new project while in the middle of a crisis might just
 cause it to fail.
 Or it could save my life!? I mean, if the crisis was that I was in a sinking
 submarine, my life in danger, then what the heck, starting a new project
 involving escape is like a really great idea, because that would allow
 me to live (i.e.
 by escaping the crisis of the sinking submarine).
 So is my current nervous breakdown, is it similar to a sinking submarine?
 Doom-scrolling and being caught in a velvet rut, how much of that is impending
 doom? I'm not a doomer.
 I don't feel like there's doom ahead.
 I rationally understand that there could be, but I don't feel it yet.
 Personality and genetics.
 My mind races.
 What should I do next? I don't know about you, but I'm going to walk the
 dog, now.
 I will do very little formal conscious, directed thinking as I do it.
 I will mostly exercise my arms and legs.
 Till later.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Ninety minutes later...

\begin_layout Standard
The meta-issue is, of course, that thinking takes focus and concentration
 and energy, aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real work
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and it is much easier to defocus and paddle downstream.
 An additional layer on top of that is converting ideation into written
 language.
 Something coherent that you have some hope of following.
 We are not James Joyce, we are not writing Ulysses, here.
 We are not writing for humans.
 Joyce had no idea that GPT lay in the future.
 He was an Author.
 A writer.
 A tortured soul of some kind seeking not just toe express but to make a
 living out of it, to get paid.
 To get by in life doing what seemed like something that could be done,
 something that he could do.
 Paint pictures, with words.
 I suppose I am painting pictures too, but in this case, I am trying to
 illuminate he inner workings of my own mind.
 Not for profit, but for posterity.
 I guess posterity is a kind of profit.
 If I live longer, in any form, I profit.
 Careful with the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

profit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Anyway, writing is sufficiently detached from the inner state that writing
 can only paint a picture of the inner mind, instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I don't think in words, I think abstractly.
 I suffer and disappoint, in the conversion of thoughts to words.
 I guess this is obvious, surely many authors have remarked and made not
 of that.
 However, I spend enough time with obtuse people that I often have to state
 the obvious.
 And so that's like a weird situation.
 I have to state the obvious, but if I don't, people assume I'm dumb.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dumb
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 has two meanings: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stupid
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lacking speech
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 I'm not stupid (compared to most people) nor do I lack is speech (I can
 be gregarious, when I want to be) but sometimes, stating the obvious bores
 me.
 But perhaps this was not obvious to you, dear reader, so I state it now.
 What a fucking mess.
 What a hell-hole.
 Cannot make forward progress, due to the drag, the friction of having to
 explain more basic things to an audience.

\begin_layout Standard
Let me tell you a story (I tell this to people, time to time.) I had a friend,
 certifiably crazy.
 Mental.
 Had to be hospitalized crazy.
 He told a joke, it was a complete non-sequiter.
 Cause, you know, he was crazy.
 Half a year later, after he was let out of the mental hospital, at a dinner
 party, he explained the joke.
 It had five or six additional stages, and, when these were spelled out,
 the joke was actually funny.
 You could laugh.
 But he had never verbalized that.
 Just the first line, and the punch line, the rest unrolled silently in
 his head.
 Such went the life of a crazy person.
 Perhaps he was sane all along, but ...
 just unable to express.
 Oh, wait.
 Well, OK, so well.
 umm, it was more subtle than that.
 When he was in the hospital, the MD gave him an integral to do.
 Calculus.
 A kind-of-ish hard integral.
 He kept converting it to one form (change of variable) and back.
 Just bouncing between these two expressions, unable to solve it.
 So this was, indeed, evidence of him being unable to control his own thought
 process sufficiently to break out of that trap, that loop.
 Well, it *was* a hard integral.
 We were in grad school.
 He was a grad student in mathematics.
 I remember looking at the integral, and thinking that the answer was not
 obvious.
 I mean, I couldn't solve it in my head, but I wasn't there to do that.
 So.
 Lucidity requires not just a string of thoughts, not just a salad of ideas,
 but a specific structure.
 And this structure must be understandable to ...
 well...
 other humans, and to yourself.
 The part about explaining the obvious to others is boring but a necessary
 part of communications.
 The part of explaining it to yourself is a necessary part of coherent developme
nt of an idea for oneself.
 (Wow, this actually ties into some quantum ideas I've had, but that's like
 a fifty-page digression.
 Later, in a different format and venue.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? Structured thought.
 Well, I know this rationally.
 Here's the trick.
 I can do structured thought while lounging in a chair.
 Walking in the park.
 Lying in bed.
 But then, if I am not careful, it evaporates.
 Perhaps it returns days later, perhaps it does not.
 How developed is it? Not much, if I don't think about it.
 Not much, if I feel no compelling reason to put it into words – either
 as some witty remark at a party, to some friends, or as some written tract
 I publish as a PDF or web page or blog or some source code.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Source code is perhaps an interesting case of development, particularly
 easy to grasp.
 I often have the vaguest feeling or inspiration for how something might
 be done.
 I can day-dream it, and then forget it.
 I can open an issue in github, and set it into words, developing it a bit
 more in the process.
 And/or I can write the code for it.
 Writing the code, debugging it, and making it actually work correctly,
 well, wow, that changes everything.
 It materializes surprising aspects that were never there in the original
 thought.
 The original though was a vector: a direction: the start of an electrical
 charge, lighting bolt, but the path to ground not yet formed.
 The actual path to ground lies in the future, still unknown, and it takes
 some surprising turns when it does form.
 And even the feelers, exporting possible routes, even these are surprising,
 these were not there in the original thought.
 The original thought was just a potential.
 Just a voltage, at the edge of atmosphere breakdown, but not yet an active
 process.
 That is what thinking is like.
 The debugged source code is the actual discharge.
 The github issue describing the idea is just a set of feelers.
 And the vague thought, possibly forgotten, is just a ...
 vague thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so, there we are.
 That's thinking.
 I'm writing here.
 I know not why, but it seems criminal if I don't write.
 Something will be lost.
 I do not know where I am going.
 It is a journey.
 Well, I do have other explicit journeys I have in mind, specifically the
 development of social contacts in Vilnius, but that is for another day.
 Not going to writ about that now.
 Right now, the topic needs to continue to be the crisis.
 Although I am not feeling the pressure of that crisis just right now, it
 feels alleviated.
 Perhaps the walk in the park, the mild hunger has taken the edge off.
 It will return, as I fall asleep, as I wake in the morning.
 But I cannot type as I sleep, and the assorted brain reading machines that
 could maybe extract some of my thinking, maybe, these don't exist.
 There are rumours of interesting developments, but you have to stick your
 head in a multi-million dollar machine, first.
 Thought-reading machines are not yet household items.
 And fuck.
 If and when they are, then ...
 I dunno.
 The feeling of crisis will surely elevate a few more notches.
 I mean, all this talk of post-human cyborg and whatnot is envigorating
 sci-fi, until the day it becomes real, in which case, the shit will suddenly
 become very real, as they say.
 The rational understanding will become an emotional response.
 A crisis, I suppose.
 A nervous breakdown, even.
 I don't see how it could be any other way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now I'm going to take a break to get some food, and return to the topic
 – the meaning of life.
 What is the universe doing? How do I navigate from here to there? Will
 I live long enough to confront the post-human crisis? Do I have five or
 ten or twenty years? Will I be able to afford it? will the medical technology
 be there? Will Western Civ loose its shit, and descend into kinetic chaos,
 with bullets flying, and I die, victim of some unforseen alt-right mass
 shooting? Victim of some black-on-white crime in Chicago? Will I make it,
 or will I die of a heart-attack in Vilnius? OK, let me get some food.
 Back in a moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wandered into the kitchen, and decided I'm not hungry.
 Not yet ready to eat.
 My stomach is not prepared.
 So I have a big glass of highly diluted orange juice in front of me.
 I like it highly-diluted.
 Maybe six to one.
 Flavor without heft.
 I am expressing a prefrence...
 why? for posterity? So you can get to know me? I can hand wave and note
 that there are plenty of humans who are gastronomes, intensely interested
 in food.
 Earlier today, I gave my son Jules a talk about all the things one can
 do as a human.
 He started the conversation by saying he thinks he's mildly autistic.
 He's not.
 He thinks he is, because he's had some large number of awkward conversations
 in high-school.
 I assured him that awkward is a hallmark of highschool.
 I think maybe he actually understood and believed me.
 Although I had to talk about qualia and the pursuit of qualia.
 Pursuit of smell, of touch, of color and shape.
 Pursuit of the more abstract, including social cues and language skills.
 Whatever, I could recap that conversation cause it's fresh in my head,
 but you are not my son, and I don't have anything that I need to teach
 you.
 Well, I do have something, but its..
 well I am teaching myself, in a way.
 Or perhaps experimenting with automatic writing.
 I'm not sure.
 Joyce did automatic writing.
 So do many college (and high-school!) students, encourage by their teachers
 to explore themselves, to explore their ability to express.
 Well, I know how to express, that is not the problem.
 I am struggling with what to do next.
 So, like writers block.
 Except its take-action-block.
 Clearly I'm writing, so that's not blocked.
 But the ocean of things I can do next, it seems so boundless, I don't know
 what to choose.
 And everything that is important, it would take many years, longer, of
 sustained effort to develop.
 So what should I pick, that is worthy of five or ten years of sustained
 effort? I don't know.
 How can I plan the next two decades? How does this work? That is why I'm
 writing.
 To decide what to do next, both at the minute-by-minute level, and at the
 day-to-day level, and the year-to-year level.
 And the need for sustained effort is intimidating, And the sinking back
 into the velvet rut, doom-scrolling through social media is so easy.
 Opium for the masses, dulling the senses, even as it pumps your brain full
 of ideas.
 So, OK, in that sense, social media is much much better for you than opium.
 What is alarming is how ...
 addictive it is.
 Harumpf.
 And so here I am again, going in a circle, again.
 Doing that change-of-variable on that integral, and back, again.
 Now what? What do I do next? Fuck.
 Fuck you.
 Fuck me.
 Fuck Fuck Fuck.
 Where was I? Right.
 The universe.
 Lets think about that for a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The universe.
 So here I am, in a certain sense, I am the universe, thinking about itself,
 etc.
 a common trope.
 My bounds of thinking do not extend beyond my experience, my body, my education
, the rutted channels oof my thoughts.
 But I try to hop the channel.
 To break out.
 Do I have free will? I started an essay about that.
 It has something to do with quantum mechanics.
 I will develop that lter.
 Not tonight.
 Maybe tomorrow.
 I don't know.
 Again, is this mental masturbation? Why bother? I've evaded the crisis,
 or the crisis has evaporated, but I am now focusing hard, trying to pull
 it back into reality.
 I want to focus on the nervous breakdown, will it into being.
 Make it happen.
 Get it done.
 Avoid the sleepwalking, avoid the velvet rut, avoid the opium addiction,
 avoid the banal day to day existance, and force the situation into a crisis.
 Neurons of the brain, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!
 Easy to say, hard to do.
 Fuck.

 Haven't clicked on it yet.

 Some subsegment of humans are experiencing this same nervous breakdown

 Be back in a moment.

OK, so Orban is able to write conventional prose, in the style acceptable
 to liberal media and the educated.
 Well-formed sentences that flow and hit all the right points, constrained
 into normalicy and conventional composition.
 No fireworks, nothing wonky, nothing suspect.
 No mental instability, no craziness, just informative prose.
 And he ..
 spells out the obvious.
 Recapitulating centuries if not millennia of modern liberal thought, from
 Ancient Greece, and a tinge of Hindu enlightenment, to say

 No, join the legion of the enlightened, the luminaries, those who are fully
 self-aware and have grasped the meaning of it all, those who can sense
 and express and be and live, unlike those pesky philosophical zombies who...
 join the Army? (FWIW, yes, I know, zombie-like obedience to authority is
 an explicitly developed trait in soldiers.
 If you are going to kill people, you can't be a wuss, and have self-doubts.
 You have to follow orders, or people will die.
 Soldiers are trained to be zombies, in a certain sense.
 Not dehumanized, no, but effective in stressful conditions, reacting automatica

 Have I mentioned that I spend hours a day tracking events in Ukraine? Yes?
 Well, let me mention it again.
 I have been, since the day the war broke out.
 What a wild ride.
 Fascinating) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See, that's the problem.
 I find the events in Ukraine fascinating.
 I've learned a bit of Eastern European history, thanks to Timothy Snyder.
 I've learned about logistics, thanks to Trento Telenko.
 Not that Trent is the highest luminary on twitter, rather, his name is
 stuck in my mind, because he recently expressed some rather ugly opinion.
 But his basic tutorials on logistics have been excellent.
 I am basic, after all.
 We all were.
 None of us had a clue.
 And so that is more interesting than what David Orban had to say, because
 Orban wrote about the obvious.
 Why did he do that? Well, he writes a newsletter, and the point of newsletters
 is to state the obvious to the readership.
 Much Like Telenko, except that I already know a thing or two about enlightenmen
t, whereas I know very little about logistics.
 What a fucking trip.
 Why am I wasting time writing this? Oh yeah, to reveal unto you my inner
 thoughts.
 To create my self-portrait.
 Because that is what this text is – an attempted self-portrait of the burning
 inner workings of my mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is work, however.
 I clicked through, and there are half-a-dozen youtube videos that suddenly
 seem appealing and rewarding to watch.
 And what should I do? Watch them, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kill some time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so I can wonder, decades hence, where all the time went? I will learn
 something by watching them.
 It will be more immediately pleasurable than continuing to sit here any
 type.
 This typing is work, its mentally taxing, it takes effort.
 Maybe less effort than social interactions, where I would have to adjust
 my drivel to the particular social setting.
 Here I can drivel away.
 My mind is on vacation while my mouth is working overtime.
 Put brain in gear before engaging mouth.
 I can do that, you know.
 I can write drivel.
 Perhaps I am writing it now.
 I'm not exactly taking a lot of time to reflect before typing.
 It's just coming out.
 Logorrhea.
 To convert the logorrhea into meaningful thoughts, I would have to stop
 and formulate ideas, and then sop and reflect on the finest choice of words
 to express those ideas.
 Fuck that.
 Lets just write! I read somewhere that thinking hard depletes one's brain
 of some certain neurotransmitter, and it makes one tired.
 I forget the name of it, right now.
 It is the same one that modulated by sports supplements, and is involved
 in athletic performance.
 This is why, apparently, college athletes can set world records in the
 summer, but never-ever during final exams.
 The mental exhaustion of studying for class exhausts the same neurotransmitter
 that you need to focus to perform at your best, athletically.
 I row.
 Did you know that? Of course you did.
 I have maybe half a dozen gold medals in US National Masters Rowing Championshi
ps.
 I have walked the straight and narrow of being an athlete.
 in some certain sense, rowing is the most difficult thing I have ever done
 in life.
 It is more difficult than physics or abstract math or studying for final
 exams.
 It requires a certain level of sheer will-power and focus and mental stamina
 and delicate finesse.
 Grace.
 A level of grace that I have never needed to harness to understand some
 blob of math.
 I mean, I'm great at focusing and applying intellectual effort to solve
 problems and achieve ends.
 But it does not hurt, it does not physically hurt, the way that rowing
 does.
 The sheer willpower needed to row and win a race is more concentrated than
 anything else I've done.
 The good news is that its over in 4 minutes, for sprints, and 20 minutes,
 for head-races.
 So there it is.
 This apparently requires some neurotransmitter that is depleted, both by
 athletic activity, and by hard thinking.
 Well, I'm not really thinking hard here (remember, this is a sample of
 my logorrhea) but well, it is not entirely effortless.
 It's a brisk walk in the park? Is that what this writing is like? A brisk
 walk? It's not max effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why? because I'm evading the crisis.
 I'm evading the nervous breakdown.
 I'm too tired to bring it into the forefront.
 If I did, I fear that I will rehash the same od steps, go in that circle,
 do that change of variable over and over, to come back where I started
 with no forward progress.
 Only exhausted a bit more than when I started.
 Is this good? I don't know.
 In row, we practice, to get better and stronger.
 Is that what I'm doing here? Practicing? Long steady-state? Should I stop
 writing, and watch youtube instead? Should I write some more, and perhaps
 luckily pick up the theme, again? Am I boring you? I'm kind of boring me.
 But I'm afraid to stop.
 If I stop writing now, I may put this down till tomorrow, till next week,
 till ...
 never.
 For fuck sake, this could be the last diary entry ever.
 Was it worth it? Too late! Its in the past.
 You can't change the past, you can't remember the future.
 You can forget the past.
 You can erase overt digital knowledge.
 Is there some quantum trace of it left, wandering the universe, after I
 hit delete on my computer? What about when I die? Is there some quantum
 imprint of my life, circulating in the universe, after I die? Well, on
 the one hand, of course there is: the memories of my children, the memories
 of everyone I have ever known.
 Of course.
 George Bailey left his mark.
 But a mark is not the same as some detailed, fine-grained imprint.
 If I wipe a disk drive today, can someone a thousand years from now reconstruct
 the contents of that disk drive, out of the quantum traces it left behind?
 I doubt it, but it is a question worth pondering for that quantum paper
 that I might not get around to writing.
 OK, so writing this last paragraph was a little more satisfying.
 Can I do it again?

Hmmm.
 Or I can call it a night.

 Best to call it quits.

Do we get tired because ...
 nature never needed to optimize us for not getting mentally exhausted?
 Why does everything with a brain need to sleep? Is it simple mechanical
 cellular repair? Or is it a time to commune with the deep quantum thermodynamic
 state, and be one with the universe? All is one? Omni padme hum? Yes, I
 sometimes give such thoughts a platform.
 But god forbid, it would have to be quite the social setting for me to
 chatter about this to other humans.
 Well ...
 and why? Well, because I don't know anyone who would actually be interested
 in such musings.
 Well, only maybe 3-4-5 people I know.
 Maybe six people I know.
 But then it would be stating the obvious, with nothing to add.
 Because they too might suspect as much, and its not like I have a fully
 developed quantum theory that sleeping and dreaming is communing with the
 universe, all-is-one state.
 The other problem is that people who get sucked into this kind of woo shit
 tend to be morons.
 With whom I cannot communicate with.
 I mean, I have a PhD in theoretical particle physics.
 I understand this stuff, dammit.
 And when I talk to someone who does not have a PhD in theoretical particle
 physics, it is a case of abandon all hope ye who enter here.
 I cannot teach it to them, and if they are willing to believe in fucked
 up quantum shit in the same way that they believe in chemtrails or bill
 gates implanting chips in your brain when you take a cover test ..
 well, fuck that.
 The human brain is plastic.
 But that means the human brain can fall out of it's skull.
 And this is part of the modern crisis.
 The human brain can be shaped into believing preposterous shit, and there
 is nothing we can do about it.
 I mean, its OK that the human mind is plastic.
 What is not OK is the mass hysteria, the group psychosis.
 The

 group psychosis for flat-earth or moon-landing denialism, or the overtly

 Like, what was the one I say today? Everyone should be kind and polite,
 because the other guy might be having a bad day, and they might be packing
 heat, and might be ready to go on a shooting rampage.
 So you should be kind and polite, and be prepared to kill everyone you

 Like WTF.
 Is that mass psychosis or what? But the twitter #2A crowd (that's 2nd amendment

 Or maybe what 1420 interviews on youtube of Moscow citizens, and some of
 the bone-chilling opinions they express.
 Makes you think: are these russians even human? How can you possible say
 something so lacking in compassion, so freaking genocidal, overtly so?
 Because, what, you are parroting Olga fucking Skabayeva? How do people
 get so fucked up? That's a semi-rhetorical question.
 Although I guess I would be interested in a more detailed answer.
 Except I do not believe that psychiatric, psychological science, neuroscience
 has advanced to the point where we can give a good answer as to why people
 believe in fucked up shit.
 I mean we can, there are books on this stuff.
 I'm vaguely aware of the general drift of things.

 And so what? So fucking what? Where do I go from here? What do I do next?
 I mean, this is important.
 The Singularity is neigh, we grasp at the straws of a post-capitalist world

 our way to civilizational enlightenment? Am I a sucker for a utopian dream?
 Of course not.
 We all know the common wisdom about utopian dreams.
 Yet we have gobs of evidence that both mammals and birds have an innate
 biological sense of fairness and justice: the utopian dream is hard-coded
 in their genetics too, and not just in the genes of primates.
 Dogs know when you mistreat them.
 Oh, and a non-sequiter detour: dogs are not philosophical zombies.
 Whatever.
 So concern for civilizational enlightenment is a valid dream.
 Utopian, of course, but valid.
 When civilizational enlightenment is reached, when we obtain nirvana, then
 perhaps that nirvana will be wrapped in crisis and nervous breakdown.
 Nobody ever claimed that utopia and nirvana is NOT a crisis! Wooooof.
 So there.
 We've got that, too.

 I'm done for the night.
 It is now exactly 22:00, exactly 30 minutes since before.

\begin_layout Subsection*
8 May 2023
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why am I writing this? Song lyrics are far more extreme, explore a far greater
 territory than I ever could.
 Also ...
 novels (I read relatively few novels ...) I imagine there are others out there
 who are also writing weird diaries intended for machine learners.
 I have incoherent, mixed feelings about this project.
 Well, shit.
 The inner voice.
 Should I or shouldn't I? Valid arguments in both directions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strongest argument might be that I am biologically-driven.
 Biological creatures have explosive (exponential) growth, until rate-limiting
 factors settle in and slow it (trees never stop growing, but flowers do.)
 As mentioned above, animals seem to have a sense of justice and decency,
 not just mammals, but animals in general.
 So there is some deep underpinning.
 Not clear how this goes from genetics to neurons to behavior: that bridge
 is scientifically unknown.
 The desire to explore and express, self-express, is human.
 My urge to write here is not a sin (even though it sometimes feels like
 that).
 I mean, wtf, all artistic expression is an outpouring, even if this particular
 self-expression is not intended to entertain others, but to ...
 find myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I hope that perhaps that will be the last outburst.
 Frankly, it is easier not to write, than to write.
 And the need to create words does interfere with the process that generates
 ideas.
 I can create both words and ideas at the same time, but not very efficiently.
 Creating ideas alone, and then memorizing the general drift and then wrapping
 words around the retained feeling of the idea, that is easier.
 Ideation is inhibited by language generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Again, I am not the first to observe the above.
 And, from what I have heard, there are people who do not ideate at all,
 without ideating purely in words.
 The so-called wordcels vs.
 the shape-rotators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also touched upon here is the thread of originality vs.
 the mundane.
 The cultural expectation that I have been raised on is that originality
 is vital, fundamental, important.
 Certainly, in academic literature, the stuff to be published must be original.
 Yet, the vastness of libraries, and even more so, the vastness of the internet
 shows that true originality is almost always absent.
 Well, hang on.
 Let me pull that apart into two distinct threads.
 One: I have created original work in physics and math.
 So, in that sense, originality is possible.
 Two: my confused thoughts, set to writing here, are not original.
 I believe that everyone has confused thoughts.
 Heck - clearly seen in PTSD and mental illness: thought confusion is starkly
 visible.
 Next, there are tens of thousands physics, math, software types, sharing
 a common background and temperment to my own, some of whom have strayed
 into the territory I'm in now.
 Of these, I believe that there are at least a dozen, if not a hundred,
 who are writing a diary such as this, with similar purpose, maybe with
 similar style.
 So here, specifically, I argue I am not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

original
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But this is a misnomer, I am 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

original
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, just that I am not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unique
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 All humans are original: they do things they've never done before.
 However, what they do is commonplace, and thus considered unremarkable.
 Going to the toilet is not something to write home about, even if each
 time is not quite like the time before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I think about this, perhaps I can give this mathematical clothing, and
 use some symbols to indicate a probability distribution of conventional
 behaviors, and then talk about the occasional forays into the unusual.
 For example, climbing Mount Everest.
 Perhaps more commonplace now, but there were the first few times, when
 this was truly a new and never-done-before thing.
 I am not climbing Mount Everest here.
 I'm not even training.
 Its more like logorrhea - a very deprecating term, belittling my actions,
 suggesting I should stop writing.
 The urge to stop writing is over-ridden by some other ...
 drive.
 Fuck I'm confused.
 I felt it, now the feeling is gone.
 There was a momentary glimpse through the clouds of that part of my brain
 that motivates me to write, distinct from the part that does the writing.
 The clouds parted, and now they closed again.
 I sit and wait for another insight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this is the problem of mundanity.
 The waiting for an insight.
 And the frustration is that almost all insights I am able to get here,
 the feels, these have all been glimpsed and sketched and developed by writers,
 by singers, by poets that have come before me so wtf why am I wasting electrons
 pointing out the well-known? Well, I gave a defense of the well-known yesterday.
 But its a new situation here: here, I am talking about things well-known
 to common human experience, vs.
 things that are must be explained in detail, if someone is to understand
 the specific communicated message.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, some more math, then.
 My thoughts here are ergodic, a space-fillig curve attempting to visit
 all points of the noosphere.
 Publishable creativity consists of editing out all the places that have
 been visited by others, and holding forth the novel, the previously unexplored.
 But the general ergodicity is unavoidable: at some point or another, thoughts
 return to conventional space.
 The mathematics of transformers, as I currently but incompletely understand
 them, are just geometry in a high-dimensional space.
 My ergodic travels are not all that different from the ergodic travels
 of GPT.
 From what I can tell, GPT is just taking a random walk through nearest-neighbor
 points located at the corners of a high-dimensional cub projected on a
 high-dimensional sphere.
 In N dimensions, a cube has 2^N corners, and so those points are extremely
 close to each-other, in the metric sense.
 The transformer is an affine transformation between spaces, but the general
 idea remains.
 GPT differs from my own thoughts in that, well, my thoughts have a yoke,
 a harness, that guides rational expression differently.
 I have extra parts that suppress hallucination.
 Mostly.
 Yadda yadda.
 Obviously, mild hallucination is vital and central for artistic creativity.
 Big hallucinations gives us phenomena like the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hi Ren
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 song.
 I digress.
 Well, with some engineering effort, someone will eventually slap a hallucinatio
n-supressor onto GPT.
 At which point, the problem of the philosophical zombie becomes a bit more
 difficult.
 But even then, even after this is done, there are still differences between
 me and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: I still have the biological, animal, mammalian, primate senses of fairness
 and justice, but also of love, loss, confusion, will, strength, determination,
 passion, empathy – the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

positive traits
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that appear to be deeply and innately biological.
 All this is apparently absent from GPT.
 And is there anyone, besides me, who is even thinking about this? I suppose
 maybe there is.
 But how are we to attach, to connect this to an LLM? It imbue these qualities?
 Or, hey: more basically: emotions: sadness, happiness, anger, love, infatuation
, obsession.
 Fuck.
 I'm not even giving a proper taxonomy here: some of these come and got
 at the one-minute timescale, some persist for hours, weeks, months, years.
 Temerpment is like climate, as compared to weather, which changes day to
 day.
 I am not trying to catalogue and give a scientific development of affects
 and emotions.
 Rather, I am invoking these as a subsystem, shared by animals (dogs certainly
 get angry.
 Fight or flight is textbook stuff.) but however well developed these are
 for animals, we have no matching AI or AGI conception for this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigh.
 Instead of prattling on about this, I should be reading technical papers
 and trying to figure this out.
 Research.
 But wait, why? I want to hasten the arrival of AGI? Well, yes, I guess
 I do.
 It carries the risk of being civilization-destroying, it carries the hope
 of solving my problems with aging: I would like to be young again, and
 have lots of sex.
 That sounds like something I would enjoy.
 Being smart, I would ask the genie for another wish: to be smarter.
 And thus, with a single step, begins the journey of a thousand miles, culminati
ng with my future as a jupiter-brain.
 The post-human apocalypse.
 Is this what I want? Well, again, there is a conventional answer for that,
 found in the sci-fi literature, and in utopian dreams.
 Innate biology seems to drive desires for justice and fairness, distinguishing
 good and evil, and craving good, rejecting evil.
 Modern sci-fi can map this onto the universe: as Carl Sagan has popularized:
 we are star-stuff, we are golden, and we've got to find our way back to
 the garden.
 All right, Joni Mitchell, then.
 Insofar as we are a part of the universe contemplating the universe itself,
 we are a part of the universe that distinguishes good and evil, and thirsts
 for good, i.e.
 for utopia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah, and now comes the question, the crux.
 How much of this universal craving for good, how much of that is due to
 quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, or whatever the physics of the
 universe we are in, and how much of it is pure math? So, for example, GPT
 is, in a sense, pure math.
 It is a purely digital creation.
 Digital transistors work because they isolate from noise: they provide
 very strong insulation from the environment.
 They allow for the creation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

universes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that are not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attached
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to our own.
 Well, obviously, we can act on them, and obviously, we can give digital
 systems effectors.
 But in the abstract, what is computed in CPU and RAM is isolated from our
 universe, except for the occasional cosmic ray that flips some bit here
 or there.
 So, in this sense, what is computed in CPU/RAM is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pure math
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, existing in it's own private Platonic cave, isolated from our own.
 (And, for GPT, those bits are used to approximate the continuum of the
 real numbers, but that seems less important, for just right now.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so, with digital computing, we are able to create universes of pure
 math, detached from our own.
 What then happens to good and evil? I've postulated that the perception
 of good and evil are biologically based, and following Carl Sagan's reductionis
t arguments, good an evil are properties of molecules and atoms, and so
 perhaps properties of quantum field theory.
 That's where reductionism goes.
 But what about the isolatted mathematical system inside the CPU/RAM? Its
 not quantum, its classical, and it's isolated.
 How is a conception of good and evil supposed to permeate into that? Ahhh
 and here I have perhaps one answer: Panpsychism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from reductionism, we've got panpsychism.
 That's also where panpsychism goes.
 Panpsychism is deeply appealing and seemingly unavoidable.
 Panpsychism says that any complex structure is going to contain some fraction
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the more complex it gets, the more integrated information there is,
 the more sophisticated and thinking and capable of qualia it is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 So panpsychism does two things: it slays the philosophical zombie, in a
 very simple manner: by denying the possibility of the philosophical zombie.
 That is, if a system is sufficiently complex to exhibit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

biological
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 behavior, it cannot be a zombie.
 The zombie is an illusion, its a philosophical daydream.
 Zombies don't exist.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Panpsychism also does another thing: it crosses the isolation barrier that
 CPU/RAM provides.
 Basically, if a system is sufficiently complex, it is psychic, and it does
 not matter if the substrate is transistors or QFT.
 So that suggests that conceptions of good and evil go with.
 The assumption here is that any psychic system, any system with qualia
 (i.e.
 everything) is capable of a perception of good and evil.
 That good and evil have a platonic reality, and are present and distinguishable
 in any system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This suggests that purely digital AGI will be able to tell apart right from
 wrong, and even have some innate drive towards good, and away from evil.
 Is this drive entropic? (Unfortunately, one can still create evil systems.
 Evil cannot be banished.
 We can create a civilization-killing AGI.) But lets set this aside: is the
 drive away from evil and towards good, is this entropic?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What do I mean by entropic, here? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(See? If I did not force myself to write, I would not have figured this
 out.
 It is not enough to free-wheel.
 One must force oneself to think.
 It is an act of will, to battle off baser hedonistic impulses, such as
 opium addiction.
 I mean, I do have to give some credit to genetics: I am predisposed to
 think abstractly.
 I do have the psychological profile typical of a physics PhD.
 And I am, in some sense, compelled to think and explore abstract thoughts.
 Is there a feedback loop, some hedonistic treadmill, that causes me to
 think deeply? Lets find out...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? Entropy vs ergodicity.
 The Bernoulli process is ergodic.
 We can make ergodic odometers that eventually visit all possible states.
 These are, in a certain sense 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

purely uniform distributions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and there is not really enough there to create an entropic gradient from
 evil to good.
 This is also at the limit of the idea of panpsychism: The Bernoulli process
 does not seem to have enough structure to ascribe to it a degree of psychic
 complexity.
 In the grand tradition, let us assign it a psychic level of zero.
 Insofar as the Bernoulli process is isomorphic to the Cantor set, then
 the same.
 And the Cantor set is isomorphic to the infinite binary tree.
 So we assign all three of these things (which are the same thing) a psychic
 level of zero.
 Insofar as the Bernoulli process implies the central limit theorem, the
 same there: Normal, Gaussian distributions are symptomatic of zero psychic
 content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how does it get to be greater than zero? Well, the infinite binary tree
 is the universal cover for graphs.
 (The Menger sponge is the universal embedding.
 Which is *not* a cover! Related idea, but different.) So clearly, to get
 some other value...
 well, consider either a finite state machine, or a probabilistic finite
 state machine, or a finite state generator.
 All of these can be visualized via their state transition graphs, and the
 amount of psychism we ascribe to those needs to be boiled down to that.
 Perhaps it is the integrated information.
 I now need to read about integrated information, since this is currently
 unknown/unclear to me, I need to be able to compute IIT for graphs, and
 stupid me, I don't know how to do this, yet.

Wo, should I continue writing, or should I take a break and read about IIT?
 Or take a break and do something else? Well, I'm taking a break, at any

As a physicist, the answer is obvious: subjectivity is an ultrametric.
 We each, as subjects, live in deep, inaccessible holes, insulated, isolated
 from the world except what comes in from the senses and flows out via communica

 And of course no symbol is sufficient to characterize subjecthood; symbols
 do not have information content, in and of themselves.
 For the Panpsychic, a symbol can only contain the information of the object
 to which it is applied, and, even then, assuming that information is accessible.
 The reader of this text does not have, and will never have a specific neural

 Perhaps this is the miner's dilemma: low quality ore.

 of the habitue? All of these bindings, in my reductionist world-view, are
 just, again, feedback loops of neurotransmitters in my brain, urging me
 forward in this activity or that, keeping me loyal to my subjects of study,
 forcing an ergodic revisit of prior thoughts, or perhaps encouraging me
 to explore new territory.
 Perhaps I'm only crossing saddle points, in some mode of compounded hysteresis
 in my thoughts.
 Leading here, there, and jumping back.

 The other is in retrospect, looking back on one of one great creations,

 with a zillion thoughts swimming in her head, which impeded her expressive
 capabilities, as she had to stop and formulate her thoughts.
 My reaction: oh darling, please, we all do that! As I read the WP article
 on Žižek, its clear that here is a man, a human, whose head is full of
 thoughts, and he can't squeeze them out fast enough.
 Is this branded

 slow thinkers better, somehow? Seems like bullshit to me.

[Žižek's] views are often too obscure to be communicated usefully to common

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bingo! But, hey, lookit ...
 was that ever the point, to communicate to common people? What do I have
 in common with common people? Painfully little, at time, it seems, and
 since I am not a revolutionary, I see no point in such communication.
 Or rather, I have no desire to infect the minds of simple folk with corrupt
 catchphrases expressing some bogus political ideology.
 If anything, bogus political ideology has been at the root of our political
 problems.
 Setting aside catchphrases is not a bad thing to do.
 The political project can be one to be nuanced, rather than blunt.

I see now that I make a similar error in my understanding of psychology.
 The reductionist viewpoint blinds one to complexity.
 The structure of a molecule? Oh it's just QM.
 But if the molecule is a ribosome, you can't reduce it to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just QM
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the actual shape of the ribosome actually matters.
 Likewise, my naive attempts to reduce consciousness to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its just graph theory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is equally naive: the shapes of those graphs matter.
 I acknowledge this consciously, but I don't know how to accept it, holisiticall
y: I'm a hammer, everything is a nail.
 I can conceive of panpsychism as a general field possessed by all sufficiently
 complex graphs, and perhaps I might even find some quasi-convincing algebraic
 formulation for it.
 Some single floating-point number characterizing the amount of consciousness
 or psyche within some graph.
 But such a single number carries almost no information: its like providing
 the molecular weight of a ribosome.
 That single number cannot capture what it is that the ribosome actually
 does.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, I am force to conclude that one must always study details, to adequately
 capture complexity.
 Yet, in possession of a finite mind, a finite lifetime, I cannot be all-seeing,
 and so ..
 how do I make progress in this quest? The ancient answer (and its a good
 answer) is to specialize, to dive deep.
 Like a root searching through soil, I must walk some gradient of intellectual
 density, finding some specialized, unique topic, and penetrate that.
 Switching metaphors: like climbers ascending Mount Everest, we each carry
 a rock to make it a bit taller.
 Switching metaphors again, like a vast battlefront, we can only advance
 some few meters where we are, and not somewhere else.
 But, in the back of my mind, I can envision the entire battlefield.
 And the commanders, they too can act effectively at that scale, even if
 the details are invisible to them.
 Filters and focus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So again: faced with the task of complexity, what should I do? What comes
 next? How does one proceed? How do I strategize my life? What do I even
 want out of life? I cannot reduce the current situation to a military 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

task and purpose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 until I know what my own strategic goals are, and I do not seem to have
 those in order.
 Well, I guess I have one strategic goal: to live longer.
 And another: become wiser and better.
 And another: bring goodness to the world: make the world a better place.
 Well, already discussed above, I think these strategic goals are biologically
 embedded.
 And as I went, I think these goals might even be panpsychic.
 There might be some algebraic gradient in the structure of graphs, that
 drives from evil towards goodness.
 Evil being, I guess, emptiness, dead-ends, destruction, death.
 I think this is actually a good working definition.
 I like it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there.
 I have a personal set of strategic goals, and I believe these are shared

Here's what I aas thinking as I tossed and turned: Perhaps we are measuring
 complexity incorrectly.
 There are some 20 or 30 amino acids, and so a peptide of 100 aminos could
 be any of 20^100 which is astronomical.
 But of these, nature only chooses billions or trillions, and not something
 astronomical.
 That is, almost none of the vast number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 configurations actually are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 So yes, (micro-)biology is complex, but maybe its vastly less complex than
 this kind of raw combinatorics suggests.
 But I don't know how to define this sense, I don't know how to measure
 this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am listening to Sean Carroll – Philosophical Issues in Quantum Thermodynamics,
 on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9COqqqsFtc (recall, I can't sleep)
 sooo at the 11 minute mark he presents Myrvold's question, which attempts
 to distinguish between Boltzmann Entropy = log of macrostate volume k log
 W vs Gibbs/Shannon entropy 
\begin_inset Formula $S=-\sum_{i}p_{i}\log p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Myrvold asks: what if I give you a specific gas in a box, with all atomic
 positions and velocities specified to infinite precision? Does the entropy
 change, or not? Some people apparently believe the Shannon entropy would
 be zero, because one specific 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 and all others are zero and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $S=0$
\end_inset

.
 But this reasoning seems wrong to me, because of ergodicity and mixing.
 Even if all atomic positions and velocities are given to infinite precision,
 the time evolution of the system means that a large number of different
 states would be promptly visited.
 Unless we are able to know what time it is, to infinite precision, we cannot
 know which of these states the system is in.
 That's because Sinai's billiards are ergodic.
 So I guess I see why this is a foundational question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But again, its resolvable-ish.
 I cannot know time to infinite precision (or positions and velocities,
 for that matter).
 Mathematically, we know that the correct foundation for this problem is
 the weak topology, which inherently encodes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unknowability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and mathematically, we know that the strong topology is fundamentally
 different.
 We also know that many things we are comfortable with in math, such as
 weak convergence in Hilbert spaces, breaks down if we use strong topologies.
 Large chunks of conventional math are nuked if we use a strong topology.
 So it is not just the physics of gases, or the definitions of entropy that
 are nuked is you specify the positions of atoms to infinite precision,
 but also plain-old calculus.
 To do calculus, you need to have a measure, and to have a measure, you
 need Borel sets...
 Borel sets encode a kind of weak topology at their core, and not a strong
 topology.
 (Hmm, I need to tighten up this statement.
 But it is true, I believe.) Basically, almost all conventional geometry
 presumes a weak topology, and cannot be coherently stated with a strong
 topology (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 illustrated by the Banach-Tarski paradox.) So Myrvold's paradox is resolved
 the same way as Banach-Tarski: you must use a measure, and if you don't
 then you get paradoxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Sean Carroll video is great! I like it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Later ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a nap...
 what I wrote above is incorrect/misleading.
 I can reduce N atoms in a box to N-1 copies of Sinai's billiards.
 Let N=2, then I have a geodesic; yes, its ergodic, it fills the space,
 eventually.
 I can specify the initial conditions to infinite precision; indeed, I have
 to, in order to have a coherent conception of a geodesic.
 I must be able to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ah hah, here is the initial direction, its 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi/3$
\end_inset

 or whatever
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As this geodesic rattles around, each collision is akin to peeling off
 something off of it's decimal expansion.
 That is, it has a symbolic dynamics.
 The symbolic dynamics being encoded in the collisions and wall crossings
 of the billiard.
 It is purely deterministic, in that it is determined by the initial real
 number that specifies the initial direction of motion.
 But the topology that we use on the symbolic dynamics is the weak topology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so that then is the ultra-breif sketch of how one gets the arrow of
 time for a classical system.
 To recap: you take the classical geodesics, describe them in terms of a
 symbolic dynamics.
 This necessarily gives them a Cantor set structure, disconnected.
 The weak topology on the symbolic dynamics allows you to write down the
 Frobenius–Perron operator.
 The spectrum of the FP operator gives the arrow of time: the dissipative
 eigenstates all correspond to eigenvalues less than one.
 The ground state, the one in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thermal equilibrium
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is the one with the Fredholm eigenvalue one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That, at least, is how it works for classical mechanics.
 For quantum, there is an apparent issue: the time evolution matrix is unitary,
 all eigenvalues are on the unit circle, and nothing dissipates.
 However, there is a way out.
 We can pull symbolic dynamics out of the hat.
 One we have symbolic dynamics, then we have FP and the spectrum of the
 FP operator.
 There will be dissipative parts of the spectrum of FP, simply because applying
 a weak topology on symbolic dynamics implies that there is a decaying spectrum.
 Sot that part is wrapped up with a ribbon on top, not a problem.
 Where does the symbolic dynamics come from?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, consider the quantum finite automaton.
 There's some initial state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and to this is applied a sequence of unitary transformations 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1},U_{2},\cdots$
\end_inset

 where (for the QFA) each 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{k}$
\end_inset

 is picked from a finite set specified by the QFA.
 The index set, the subscripts on these unitary transforms provide the symbolic
 dynamics! It is quite easy to pick some collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{k}$
\end_inset

 such that the resulting mixed state is space-filling.
 That is, each specific state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is just a pure state, a single point, but the mixed state, of all of these
 different states corresponding to the different sequences of the 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{k}$
\end_inset

 generate pure states that are splattered everywhere over all of the possible
 state space (and necessarily fractal, since the index set is necessarily
 Cantorian.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But where does the selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{k}$
\end_inset

 come from? Ah, well, here, I imagine the system in a thermal bath, and
 each interaction with a thermal photon is a 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{k}$
\end_inset

 ...
 well, there's some infinite regress here.
 So lets consider a simplified model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a single qubit in a pure state.
 Such a pure state is a single vector pointing in some specific, precise
 direction on the Bloch sphere.
 A point.
 Consider two unitary transforms A and B, which rotate this qubit by pi/5
 along the x axis and the y axis.
 These correspond to the A and B rotations of Banach-Tarski.
 Let a grad student in the lab flip a coin, and apply either A or B to the
 system.
 After any amount of finite time, the qubit remains in a pure state, since
 both A and B were unitary.
 However, if we look at the set of all possible coin-flips, it is a Bernoulli
 process, isomorphic to the Cantor set.
 The coin-flips form an ergodic sequence, the resulting pure state of the
 qubit takes an ergodic walk over the Bloch sphere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a classical point state takes an ergodic walk, we say its in a thermally
 equilibrated microstate.
 Here, we seem to have constructed a pure quantum state, evolving via unitary
 transforms, under control of the coin-flipping grad student.
 The quantum system is taking a random walk, and is ergodic, thanks to the
 coin flips, but remains in a pure-state always.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mystery question here is now what? How much time and effort should I
 expend, making the above example more precise? Should I even publish this
 example?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, let's proceed along the lazy path, of jabbering here instead of trying
 to construct a carefully argued presentation.
 So the outline, again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Bloch sphere.
 This is the sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}$
\end_inset

 and any point on this sphere is a pure state, a qubit 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Lets take 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\left|+z\right\rangle $

\end_inset

 along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

axes, respectively.
 (Write these out explicitly, just to be clear.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A grad student, who flips a coin, and applies either 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{A}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $U_{B}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The result, after 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 coin flips, is still a pure state.
 However, it has taken a random, ergodic walk on the qubit.
 (Create a computer simulation of this process, showing that the resulting
 walk is ergodic.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the Cantor set to provide a sequence of indexes 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 for a sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{A},U_{B}$
\end_inset

creates a map from the Cantor set to a space-filling curve on the Bloch
 sphere.
 Called a Cesaro curve, if I recall correctly.
 (Todo: Create a simulation, showing this curve.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This curve manifests the ergodic hypothesis, i.e.
 shows that there is a Frobenius-Perron operator, with a Fredholm eigenvalue
 of 1.
 This is the

\begin_layout Enumerate
Write down the FP operator explicitly.
 Illustrate how it's eigenvalue-one ground state is just a uniform distribution

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We can now show that there are mixed states that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decay
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ergodically to the uniform distribution.
 For example, consider a mixed state that is spin-up, and a bunch of other
 nearby states.
 That is, prepare a mixed state that, if we were to measure it, it would
 mostly measure spin-up.
 But we won't measure, we'll just prepare a mostly-spin-up mixed state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let the grad student do the coin flips.
 This will, over time, smear the mixed state so that it it is uniformly
 distributed over the Bloch sphere.
 That is, if a measurement was performed, we'd se 50-50 spin up/down.
 (But we are not performing measurements.)

\begin_layout Standard
There are several key missing pieces.
 Lets review them.
 First, a convincing argument that a stream of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{A},U_{B}$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by environmental sources.
 That is, instead of coin-flips by students, there's a stream of random
 unitary transformations coming from thermal sources.
 But what is the nature of these thermal sources? How do they actually work?
 I can't just say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lets pretend 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{A}$
\end_inset

 is representative of some random thermal photon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because this is not how photons actually work.
 This is in part because of an infrared catastrophe: I don't have any particular
ly good way of splitting up the thermal bath into a sequence of individual
 photons, and then summing, integrating these, and taking the limit.
 This is for several reasons.
 First photons are not like billiard balls, but even if they were, billiards
 are hard.
 Sinai's billiards is an oversimplification, but its hard.
 What we need here is a photonic, unitary version of Sinai's billiards.
 Hmm.
 Well.
 Maybe that's doable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue is that the above has the qubit, in isolation.
 A more accurate model would have it entangled with other qubits.
 Hmm.
 Maybe I should work this out in a paper...

 Unpruned branches are star, while pruned ones are 0 or 1.
 So we are just specifying cylinder sets, here.
 Err, well, we also have nil, which prunes both left and right branches.

 And then mapping these to Turing machines.
 I never really explored this, and am already stuck on the basics.

 This mapping should not be *hard*, it seems straight-forward enough.
 Just that it somehow suggests there will be surprising implications, or
 that I don't really understand the big picture here.
 And then comes the perennial question: is this worth pursuing, or not?
 Should I write this out, or not?

 There are no solutions to the "AI alignment problem" until we get a better

nordizvaus — 06/12/2023 4:10 AM i think though the bigger point of something
 like mastodon or matrix or lemmy or any of these open source projects is
 that they are a step towards better places ..
 and until we all realize this the internet either gets built around us
 by corporations with there own alignment and it will continue to just enshitify
 itself and by consequence the minds of billions of people.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 5:59 PM Well, there's a weird balancing act.
 The "flavor" of a community, it's acceptance, its values, it's inclusiveness/ex
clusiveness depends a lot on the detailed design of rules, like upvoting,
 downvoting, muting, ...
 Experimenting with these is hard for open source; the corporations have
 money for this.
 The open-source world is fairly "thin", there are not that many programmers,
 sysadmins...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And besides, there are assholes everywhere ...

\begin_layout Standard
Look at wikipedia, one of the grand successes ...
 most WP articles got written between 2005 and 2011 and have been in stasis,
 ever since (you can see this in the edit history) Here's why ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During this same timeframe (2005-2011) there was (still is) this idea of
 "admins" who would have exceptional powers.
 (to delete, kick, ban, etc.) You got to be an admin by a popularity contest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of people who had ego issues, inferiority complexes and needed to
 be recognized, rewarded and worshiped put a lot of effort into becoming
 popular, and getting elected.
 And they did get elected.
 Several outcomes from this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 6:08 PM First, most admins are bullies.
 They are non-experts, but their opinions are golden, irrefutable, unchallengeab
le.
 Tangle with them you get blocked.
 So around 2009-2013, all of the domain experts, all of the professors,
 all the experts got harassed and hounded off of wikipedia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of them were Professor Emeritus, i.e.
 retired, lots of time on their hands, no job responsibilities, and 5 decades
 of expertise.
 They were all stabbed to death, metaphorically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And you see this legacy today, at least in WP:math and WP:physics -- there
 are about six (yes, less than ten) "good guys", actual math people who
 know their stuff: hard-core long-time participants, and they overlook about
 22K articles in math.
 Six people.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 6:15 PM Physics is more like four people, and they are
 more like Master's Thesis type people, not even "deep experts" but smart
 enough to understand the general orthodoxy.
 They also deal with about 20K articles.
 Four people.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's about another dozen more casual hangers on who create things, and
 are semi-plugged in.
 I'm one of them.
 We all know who we all are.
 And maybe another dozen or two very casual visitors, many/most grad students
 and college profs.
 And they're OK.
 Then there's the several hundred cranks, kooks, college freshmen who show
 up and create havoc.
 It gets cleaned up, but its endless low-level policing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moral of story: the UI design, of popularity-contest voting for admins,
 created a class of fragile-ego assholes who have shut down, halted wikipedia
 development, for over a decade now.
 WP has not recovered from this damage yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 6:25 PM The articles are more-or-less accurate, usually.
 They're inadequate, thin, missing important content.
 Stuff you'd find in Chapter One of textbooks is just plain missing.
 So I'm not knocking it for accuracy, but for balance, emphasis.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The urge to write.
 I had it many hours ago.
 But I was far from the keyboard, and could not fulfill the urge.
 Lets see if I can capture it again.
 The shock of the new.
 That is what threw me into the air, the intellectual air, all excited.
 A jumble of thoughts danced in my mind, no one dominant, but a theme.
 I even worked out a story line a bit later, a plot-line.
 should I reproduce tat now, or should I talk about something else? Are
 these the last dregs of the inspiration, or can I catch the wave again?
 Should I report in chronological order? Does it matter? This is, after
 all, an idea-salad of assorted thoughts, thrown out in a jumble, with no
 intended human readership as a target.
 I keep saying this, as if its important.
 I keep saying this, to free myself from the compulsion to organize these
 thoughts into a clear and structured development, suitable for entertaining
 other (human) readers.
 It takes time and effort to entertain humans, and I do not want to put
 in that time and effort right now.
 The result is an unreadable mess, but by offering excuses, I can at least
 avoid the embarassment of looking stupid for failing to organize my thoughts
 as is culturally demanded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK so maybe that's a good starting point.
 What is culturally demanded? I was in Kaunas today.
 I visited the Kaunas Picture Gallery.
 On the first floor, an exhibit of modern art – the topic being posthumanism,
 transhumanism.
 I liked it.
 As Art, with a Capital A, it was good Art.
 Relatively early, the thought entered my mind: this resembles the Futurism
 of 1920's Italy.
 The critique, here, is that in the 1920's, Italy was not in the forefront
 of industrial development.
 A bit of a backwater, even.
 Curiously, this was just the right recipe for Futurism to develop.
 The future was visible, I guess from news articles from England, from Germany,
 from the US, replete with photos, magazines, books, moving pictures even.
 These were inspiring, especially so to the ones one the edges, rather than
 the center.
 The center is too central - you can't see the forest, the trees are in
 the way.
 So here, in Kaunas, Lithuania's second city, far away from New York, far
 away from the inception of transhumanism that can be traced back to the
 1970's even.
 Fifty years later.
 But are we transhuman yet?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I've been wearing glasses all my life.
 But vision-corrective glass have been around for centuries.
 I have twelve screws in my left ankle.
 Does that make me trans-human? Well, such surgery is impossible without
 modernity (lets ignore the deep history of weird surgical procedures, and
 stick to the commonplace.) Perhaps one isn't transhuman, until one is permanentl
y connected to electronics? Do heart pacemakers count? Certainly cell-phones
 are a prosthesis, but one is not a cyborg until there are wires in your
 skull.
 We don't, a this time, have cyborgs.
 I don't know quite where the transhuman line should be drawn.
 It seems we are not there yet.
 And so, the art exhibit.
 It tries to evoke a future that has not yet arrived.
 It tries to describe that future, without being a text (although one of
 Lord Byron's poems, about a volcanic eruption in 1815, is used as the introduct
ory text).
 It's not a Hollywood movie, with a plot, although it has several video
 installations.
 The vision of transhumanism, post-humanism was presented ...
 viscerally.
 Not through reason or story-telling, but through direct sensory flooding.
 Sound, loud, unconventional visual images.
 Stark.
 Direct.
 Whatever.
 I liked it.
 I took some photos.
 I'll post them into emails home.
 Later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the way out, I was struck by a thought.
 The presentation was apolitical.
 Or rather, I think it was apolitical.
 It was outside the Overton window of political discourse.
 Either you follow the general outlines of sci-fi (because you like it)
 or you don't.
 Either you've heard of transhumanism/posthumanism through your hipster,
 plugged-in friends, or you haven't.
 And if you haven't, you have no opinion of it, positive or negative.
 The democrats and republicans have not yet formed opinions on it.
 No one is writing toxic screeds against the transhumanists.
 Yet.
 Except, oddly, in the one place where it is the most viscerally direct:
 trans-sexuals.
 No one cares if you ave a bionic arm.
 But if you have a bionic dick, watch out.
 Well, I guess the debate is not so much about what adults do, but rather,
 that of holding children sancrosanct.
 Hmmm.
 And here, perhaps, the conservatives are right.
 To veer off into the transhumanist apocalypse as children is perhaps still
 a bit too early.
 To be driven by sexuality is even more so.
 Sexuality is too deeply rooted in the psyche to bee toyed with, lightly.
 The loss of a limb - arm or leg - is traumatic.
 But we cope.
 Sex, however, is weird.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so there – there we have it – the transhuman boundary.
 The boundary is where it gets weird.
 The boundary is where children should not go.
 The boundary is where things get dangerous and hallucinogenic and psychotic.
 Where psychic trauma is induced.
 That is the boundary of transhumanism.
 Huh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have I laid this topic to rest? Is there more to be said? Should I try my
 hand at prognosticating the technological future? I dunno.
 I find it oddly boring.
 I am happier to read sci-fi, than to try and invent it.
 I guess.
 I'd rather do math.
 Or other things.
 The things that have captured my interest, at the time they capture my
 interest.
 I could tell you all about this, but I fear I would bore myself.
 I'm already boring myself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, so another thought I ad, earler today: I think I like Lithuania, because
 it offers a contrast to the modernism of the united states.
 There is a very plugged-in world, issuing from Silicon Valley, to a lerge
 degree, but more generally from the cultured Americans doing their on-line
 thing.
 A boiling intellectual stew-pot.
 Something that is not visible in Lithuania – Lithuania is at the edges,
 not the center.
 This provides contrast.
 The contrast sharpens the image, in some odd way.
 It reminds you that there is a difference.
 But I'm not sure how to put my fingers on it.
 How to put it into words.
 The urge for deep introspective writing is passing ....
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to urges to write: well, I could have burnt out this urge by sharing
 drinks with friends.
 A good long chat with someone would have burned this right out my system.
 So am I talking to you, blank page, in lieu of friendship? Well, no, not
 quite.
 Talking to people derails thoughts.
 The thought that I am having now, the thread I am developing, it would
 get derailed by the other person.
 They would interject their own thoughts, feelings, emotions.
 Change the subject in some unexpected direction.
 And, for me, to remain socially connected, must accommodate.
 I can't just go on a philosophical tirade, like some unhinged street-person,
 or like a university professor reading a lecture in class.
 I am not in class, I would be in dialog with someone else.
 Whereas here, dear blank page, I am more like that lecturer.
 Except I am much freer.
 I ave no obligation to inform students.
 I have no obligation to provide a coherent development.
 I can just type whatever I feel like.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever I feel like.
 This is perhaps something else that is worth talking about.
 Something that I've been unable to formulate, although I sense it: the
 words that I write are driven by feelings, sensations, of what the next
 thing to say is.
 The next thought I should have.
 Oh, and on a few very rare occasions, I have been able to observe myself
 thinking.
 I was able to notice a choice of two or three unfinished thoughts, thought-sket
ches, like offerings on a menu, with the understanding that only one of
 these could be fleshed out into a fully-finished thought.
 And hen, somehow, I choose one, and then, fractions of a second later:
 there it is, the fully-formed thought, complete this time.
 It was a bizarre feeling.
 Being aware of that menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've also observed that menu in dreams.
 Again, very rarely, only a handful of times: where a choice of possible
 dream-plots presented themselves, and I was able to weigh them: should
 I dream about this, or about that? Pick the one that seems like the most
 fun.
 And so I tried to pick that.
 I'm not sure I was successful; though.
 Some of my dreams are tremendously fun.
 And some are tremendously frustrating, failing to take off in any exciting,
 invigorating direction, and instead circling a drain of tired, captured
 plots, empty of people, of color, wandering a maze of architectural spaces
 that are empty and not very rewarding, as I've seen them all before.
 There is nothing to find there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, the last two paragraphs provide a foundation stone for a broader
 theory of mine, that human thought, human expression, is driven by this
 feeling-ness of what to do next.
 Argh.
 Well, look, I'm tired and sleepy, and I'm having o force myself to write
 and think here, and like those dreams that go nowhere, so also my thought
 process is shutting down, and threatening to go nowhere.
 So perhaps, lets call it a night.
 'll go to sleep now, and very likely the urge to write, in this diary,
 will have passed.
 Something else will seem more important.
 And priorities are priorities, Even if they are of some detrimental nature:
 just like addiction closes off possibilities and keeps you in a channel,
 so also do priorities.
 I'm addicted to wasting time, doing something that is not creative.
 I'm addicted to consuming mid-low-grade sensory input: hikes in the forest.
 Reading Twitter for hours.
 Following the Ukraine war news.
 Following my nose, instead of planning and judging and ranking what is
 truly important.
 No strenuous upriver paddles; its all a downhill swim in the gentle stream
 of intellectual stimulus.
 That gentle stream only rarely provokes splashes of creative outburst.
 Kind of a shame, really.
 Well, we'll see.
 Nighty-night.

Why am I stewing and unhappy? The shock of the meeting.
 HDC Elipse 2023 on Eugene Oregon.
 Objectively, it was a great meeting, I met lots of neat people, people

 important topics, while also being social and enjoying one-another.
 So what's the problem?

How do I even begin to explain to you dear reader, what all of these words
 mean? What they refer to in this text.
 Words have no meaning is what I told to Joscha Bach, trying to recapitulate
 in one short phrase the broader idea that meaning is fluid and context
 dependent.
 He did not like that, because he is argumentative.
 He's mreo than just argumentative, maybe I will write more about that later.
 He's a bit of a jerk.
 And maybe on the verge of a mental breakdown.
 How do I know? Well he confided the last to me in private, so I should
 not write it here and violate that privacy but what the hell.
 When AGI is in the future, all bets are off.
 As to the former, he called me crazy, which was hurtful and upset me.
 After much thought, pondering alternative explanations, I decided that
 he was projecting, just a bit.
 The ostensible reason for this name calling was a too-abbreviated conversationa
l technique.
 So both Joscha, and the TPOT Eigenrobot have this habit of not verbalizing
 the obvious, as it just adds un-needed words for info that can be assumed
 from context.
 Of course, this works only when the context is apparent to the listeners.
 This is not always the case.
 Apparently, Joscha needed more context than I provided him.
 Thus he did not understand what I said.
 And deduced that I was not actually saying anything meaningful.
 Pointed out that there is a breakdown of communications.(and clearly, there
 was) and accused me of being crazy.
 Because he was too fucking lazy to engage in the conversation to figure
 out what I was saying.
 Asshole.
 It made me feel bad.
 But it would appear that he is like that, in general.
 Even a shallow survey of others reveals this.
 Oh well.
 So it goes.
 It none-the-less contributes or contributed my feeling bad this morning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But rather than stewing in my juices, I decided to write, and it is making
 me feel better.
 I'm unburdening myself.
 Or perhaps I am finding my default mode, which is that comfortable place
 where I can idle and feel good.
 To be the sheep, instead of the wolf.
 To glow in a state of comfort, instead of hustling, pushing, trying harder.
 Which is a painful activity.
 Painful psychologically.
 Grabby aliens.
 The primary concept of grabby aliens is that to the victor fall the spoils.
 Be first, win the whole enchilada.
 That's n the galactic scale.
 On the planetary scale, its the race to AGI: first across the gate wins
 all.
 Perhaps it's much like that bacteria plate with the variable concentrations
 of antiboitic on it.
 Barriers are overcome.
 In modern Western capitalism, the hustler wins.
 In corporate business, promotions go to strivers.
 In politics, the one who pushes harder, but pushes just right, wins.
 In jungles, it is eat or be eaten.
 The carnivores eat the herbivors.
 The herbivors eat the plants, who are unlucky to have a biochemical system
 that runs at a rate that is a thousand times slower than that of animals,
 and thus cannot react fast enough to defend themselves.
 At least, the herbivores can run, when chased by a carnivore.
 It would seem that nature is raw, competitive and bloody, both in the pre-human
 level, at the human level, and even, it seems, a bit at the noosphere.

There is an apparent contraction here, should remark on.
 Humans build cathedrals; at least, the humans steeped in Western Culture,
 and who have gained the freedom to perform engineering.
 Such activity requires blissed quiet thinking, which is antithetical to
 the hustle.
 The hunt, the active predatory mindset, the edge of fight-or-flight, this
 is not a good mental state for engineering and thought.
 I enjoy the blissful sheep state, thinking calmly, pleasantly, rather than
 feeling the stress of survival mode excitation.

 Does not have all that much of an idea of me as an existential form and
 being.
 Where am I at? WHo am I? I want to think and act, calmly and pleasantly,
 without a care in the world.
 Sometimes I have that luxury, adn sometimes I don't (the word luxury is
 evocative.
 Words don't have meanings, I told Joscha.
 Words evoke, rather than being precise.
 Whatever, I digress.
 What I write here is necessarily evocative, because there are no deep mental
 probes in my mind that can transmit my state to you, my dear reader.

If I apply the rule that "the meaning of a word is defined by the sentences

 which is different again from that of libertarians...

\begin_layout Standard
This is the path to "alternative facts" or disinformation in general: you
 can make words mean anything you want, simply by changing the context they
 occur in.
 Of course, you need large (huge) volumes of text, before you can make the
 Bayes priors budge.
 This is why ...

\begin_layout Standard
This is why mass-media or viral tweets are needed to create/spread "alternative

 Both humans and LLM's are sensitive to this distribution.
 You can pollute an LLM by feeding it propaganda, not unlike cult indoctrination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also the basis for how LLM's "hallucinate", as @GaryMarcus likes
 to talk about.
 When there is not enough prior evidence to connect two n-grams, oddball
 statements arise.
 LLM's are not filtered on elementary school arithmetic, which is why they
 make math errors.

I have no clue what I will write about now.
 It's been a while.
 My memories of prior writing episodes is that they were enjoyable and somewhow
 constructive.
 But then, everything I do these days is vaguely enjoyable.
 That's almost a problem: I'm not being driven by aversion.
 Well, I'm not being driven at all.
 SHmm.
 Should I write about insecurity? What should my priorities be? What should
 I do next? It's a cosmic problem.
 It's very easy to just surrender to the flow, to do what feels good.
 Sometimes, this means forcing myself to do things.
 Status report: for the last two months, I forced myself to do research
 on the beta transform.
 Why? Who knows.
 I mean, OK, so it's kind of the only thing I've done since the last diary
 entry, so may a well talk about that.
 Surrender and talk about that.
 Surrender again to whatever it is that makes me tick.
 Force myself into doing more than I would otherwise do.
 For example, I had to stop some synthewwve music just now on youtube, because
 it was breaking my concentration in writing this.
 Why am I writing this.
 you ask? Because it is a well-deserved vacation after the two-month-long
 beta transform stint.
 Just letting my my mind ooze along not force, just kicking back.
 Do I even know how to kick back any more? Its like ..
 I force myself into doing things.
 Why? Am I even making tthe right choices? Let's write about insecurity,
 after all.
 Famous people who do important things are driven, or so everyone says.
 Am I driven? I suppose, I force myself.
 What am I driven by? Err, ahh, I guess the thrill of a mathematical discovery.
 Am I any good at math? Err, well, better than some, worse than others.
 Much, much worse than the greats.
 wtf am I doing? why am I wasting time writing this diary? Why am I concerned
 about wasting time? What's the priority list, again? Why do anything? Why
 not just kick back and relax and listen to more synthwave music? Have I
 mentioned that music is an earwrom? Over the last 5+ years I've found that

 well, I still enjoy music, but I have to kind of avoid it, because otherwise
 it sticks in my head and plays all night as I sleep, and it disturbs my

What else? So today was a kind of evening off, and I watched a youtube video
 of a kid who is schizo recording himself having a schizo episode, voices
 and bands in his head.
 Mostly coherent, but running in circles, and it's perhaps remarkable, perhaps
 made me think that, well, isn't that what I'm doing here? Well, disclaimer:
 I'm not having a schizo attack.
 However, I am talking into electronic media, engraving my voice into written
 electrons.
 Well, not my literal voice, and sadly forgoing umpteen $$ in youtube income.
 I suspect youtube income, or perhaps fame, corrupts.
 I mean Sabine Hoffstader is smart, and I've watched three or four of her
 videos, and the more she opines about common-day-to-day things, the more
 I find I disagree.
 Is this because she's been corrupted by the youtube money? Or is it simply
 because, well, she is not me? Like no one is exactly me.
 Everyone is like me.
 But everyone is different, and you all are alien.
 Oh BTW, have I mentioned that I beleive that everyone is kind-of-like crazy?
 It's like the schizo kid who hears the voices in his head; I guess it's
 bad enough for him that he is not actually functional.
 And if you watch other films on youtube documenting craziness, you realize
 the uniting theme is an inability to function in the

 What I guess is why lots of people these days make fun of normie society.
 Whwere was I going with this? Well, I have a theory that more or less everyone
 is more or less kind of crazy in some way.
 (Dislaimer: I'm sane.
 I think I might be hyper-sane.
 There's some youtube video that claims that hyper-sane people exist.
 I can't bear to waste time on such hypothesis, but that might be because
 I'm hyper-sane myself.
 Which is why I'm comfortable writing train-of-thought screeds into this
 diary, to you, dear reader, and comparing myself to the crazy person talking
 into a camera, and not...
 whatever.
 wtf.
 ancient romans and greeks wrote diarys.
 Aristotle wrote books.
 Medieval scholars wrote endlessly about God, for chris sake.
 So my writing here, to you should not be stigmatized as if I was some mental

 not entirely interested in recalling all the details, but I am plagued
 by the same doubts: what should I do next? What is the point? Maybe like
 that schizo kid (the one with the German flag on his wall, in the background)

 All this is distracting of my desire to make a passing mention of another
 topic that I've been hot-n=bothered by, for the last 5-10 years: the use
 of mind-warping, thought-warping KGB truth-reality disinformation yadda
 yadda, like what Pekka Kollioniemi writs about in vatnik soup, or what
 Jim Stewartson writes about -three hurrahs! or Peter Pomerantsev and I'm
 a fucking amateur enthusiast of these ideas.
 Fucking amateur enthusiast.
 Which brings me back to the original problem: how does one avoid being
 amateur, and gain enough focus and drive and concentration to actually
 do something? Or is being driven just another psychological umm, trap?
 Does one have free will, if one is driven to do something? Of course, one
 can be driven and make choices.

Do we have realistic prospects on no nuclear weapons until we have such

 However, there are a lot of architectural possibilities that remain ignored,
 unexplored in the mad rush to get rich quick off of LLM's.

 for that.

 working on this? (is anyone with a budget working on this?) Zar Goertzel

I need to reboot my AGI efforts.
 There are meta questions that I've been avoiding.
 I have a long coherent story about pattern recognition.
 There is more to AGI than that.
 There's so much to say.
 Where shall I start? Lets start with the current system.
 It has no episodic memory.
 It needs to get a sense of passing time, of distinct events.
 A time-stamp won't do it; its just another datum to the system.
 On the other hand, the sensation of time is bundled with the sensation
 of self-awareness; there must first be a sense of me, of existance, and
 only then(?) can a sense of the progression of time emerge.
 So we are working at too low a level; the system has no self-awareness.
 Time-stamped data won't hurt, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of welf-awareness is a sense of self and other, me and external world.
 Part of that is via interaction: action, reaction, fuck around, find out.
 The current system has no interactive ability in the real world.
 This could be partly cured by getting the generator to start generating
 strings, and to hook it up to IRC for I/O.
 We can expect the system to generate a word-salad, a random walk.
 To hallucinate, to dream.
 How does one interact with a dream, so as to wake it up? I could hard-code
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 command, but to what effect?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conscious systems interact through pain, joy, fear, hunger: basic emotions.
 They have goal-directed behavior.
 Jellyfish have goal-directed behavior: a need to eat.
 This is a biological imperative, and can be hard-coded.
 That is, basic cellular biology means eating, living off of energy gradients
 and molecular gradients, is a prime directive.
 The current AGI has no such prime directive; so there is no lowest-level
 loop to be modulated.
 That is, eating can be thought of as a simple thermostatic control loop,
 and higher functions then proceed as modifications to this basic loop.
 The current system design does not have any sort of basic survival drive
 loop that can serve as a seed for modification and enhancement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obvious, just hard-coding one is dicey: one risks the paperclip maximizer.
 On the other hand, bacteria and other low life-forms are paperclip maximizers.
 They'd eat anything and everything, and convert it into bacteria, if they
 could.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I assume jellyfish interpret damage as pain, and thus flee predators.
 So that's the basic enhanced loop.
 So, our AGI has no prime directive, and no predators/pain/survival motivation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could code up curiosity as the basic survival drive.
 Then a lack of sensory input could be perceivable as pain? Is this robust?
 In the grand scheme of things, I dunno.
 We'll explore this more, later.
 But for now, how would this work? How could we make it work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sticking to the jigsaw-piece paradigm, this requires the creation of a basic
 assembly, representing the ingestion of text, and the processing of it.
 This is currently written as shell scripts, it needs to be jigsawed and
 vectorized.
 How?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distinct from this is the evolutionary drive.
 In biological life, the mechanisms for he earliest life forms are driven
 by robustness and suvival.
 If a mechanism could not survive, it would not reproduce.
 It would grow while food was abundant, and then die, when overheated, dried
 out, frozen or hungry.
 This guarentees selection of organisms that are fit, creating an indirect
 drive towards complexity.
 So even if I hand-created a jigsaw for text ingestion, there's no drive
 for creating a better system.
 Can we jigger up something to do this?

 what exactly? A secondary concern is the feedback bandwidth is much too
 low.
 I would have to provide a billion years of reinforcement rewards to shape
 anything manually.
 What would a high-bandwidth reinforcement learning system look like? Where's
 the reinforcement coming from? One temptation is to build a bot that spams
 social media, and let humans train it.
 This is quasi-unethical.
 But it also avoided the earlier question: what is this feedback actually
 doing? How is it actually modifying the structure of the system? What's
 the mechanism for that? Hmmm.

 question, that would drive the mutation of the system.
 There's also a mechanical issue: given a drive, how does the mechanics
 work? The second question seems more important: without mechanics, nothing
 happens.
 The first question can be made provisional.
 (Certainly that's what supervised training does: it imposes an external
 driver to the system.)

Certainly, could create basic I/O nodes, similar to the StorageNode, that
 could transform data.
 The LGNodes already do this.
 The ProxyNodes already allow processing steps.
 There aren't any sort of nodes for increasing or decreasing activation
 (upregulate or downregulate).
 Such nodes would be needed for controlling activity.
 Such nodes are relatively straightforward to architect and implement.
 Should they be? It would allow for ongoing experimentation to clarify thoughts.
 Should I try to think further ahead, or is this sufficient? Should I be
 activity based, or thinking-based?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideas are easy to generate, especially for software engineering.
 To weed them out and to pick the best ones is hard.
 It requires hard thinking (and I'm lazy) or it requires experimentation
 (which is fun, because its like playing solitaire, just at a more sophisticated
 level.) Hard thinking allows grandiose plans to be created, without getting
 closer to the goal.
 So activity-based activity is desirable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goals.
 The conventional AI idea is to create a world model, sensory infrastructure
 to update that world model (including the placement of self inside of it)
 and action subsystems to act upon the world.
 Action often means generation, at the chatbot level: the world model is
 a language model, generation spews sentences.
 However, sentence spew requires a general idea to be given voice to.
 The LLM's seem to be question-response systems, without autonomy.
 Statements (questions) are posed to the LLM, they then riff in a linguistically
 coherent way about the topic that that the question excited.
 So the question acts as an exicitory stimulus.
 The prompt-engineering subsystem is a collection of excitatory and inhibitory
 stimuli, designed to prevent certain expressions.
 They are engineered, they are not evolved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architecture.
 Conventional software architecture is to build a rigid system.
 Yes, there are config files, but flexible component structure remained/remains
 an unfulfilled dream.
 The above paragraphs evoke the construction of a flexible self-mutable
 system (which is what the AtomSpace is).
 The old bugaboo was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

self-modifying code
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 this is more of a constrained system of parts that can be rejiggered easily.
 It's showing up already, certainly TensorFlow is like that, for GPU pipelines,
 Docker is like that, for OS/application-sized workloads.
 AtomSpace is like that, but low-level, fine-grained.
 But also, the containerizatin/cloud stuff is not really self-modifying;
 its designed for rapid deployment/redeployment by systems operators who
 know what they are doing.
 In this text, I want to give autonomy over to higher-order processes.

Now, of course, modern western tech is already evolving towards this; it
 does not need my vision or action to do this.
 It will get there.
 I'm charting a specific path, for my own entertainment.
 I could just kick back and relax, and wait for someone else to do it, while
 I admire the spectacle of what's going on.
 That's one choice.
 Another choice is to get employment that results in a career path in which
 I get to create/dictate such work at the organizational level.
 I'm too old to start that journey; time's up for that.
 The third choice is to hack on the AtomSpace, and try to leverage the tiny
 lead I have.
 Is there a fourth choice?

The current learning pipeline seems to be proven at the low end but has
 multiple problems.
 Listing randomly from trite to serious: First, there's some sort of threading
 bottleneck in scheme that prevents it from running in parallel.
 Overcoming this would require moving the matrix/vector code to C++.
 A chore, but doable, as the general idea is fairly clear.
 Second is combinatorial explosion: the current pipeline is a batch pipeline,
 and the batch sizes get too large, and then inventing trimming algos is
 hard.
 So having an integrated system, where learning at different levels happen
 simultaneously.
 Third, the mining of correlations has not been demonstrated out to large
 sizes.
 It works for word pairs, and disjuncts, but we've not scaled to anything
 larger.
 It would seem that the batch processing is the bottleneck for scaling up,
 so integration is forced.
 Fourth, there's no GPU scaling infrastructure.
 Doing gradient descent on GPU's is blisteringly fast; the counting algorithms
 are tens of thousands of times slower.
 That sucks.
 So these are the short-horizon, immediate issues that have been swirling
 for a while.
 Bigger picture and more distant is the lack of episodic memory.
 The lack of motivation loops, or good-regulator loops for world-model construct
ion and maintenance.
 The lack of a reward system, akin to food, to drive evolutinoary changes,
 The lack of a goal, other than paperclip maximization, to drive behavior.
 At low level, absence of a sensory system.
 A chatbot just barely cuts it, constrained and low bandwith.
 Unclear how to even think about the high-level architecture problems until
 a suitable infrastructure for the low-level stuff exists.

\begin_layout Standard
Where does this leave me? One immediate conclusion is to keep plinking on
 the code.
 Then continue to ponder motivational structure.
 Continue reading texts.
 So, no change from current activities; its like we're on course.
 Get a paying job.
 Hah hah.
 Preach to the void, which is not really working out.
 Think hard about how to gain power, at the cost of thinking hard about
 other things.
 Spend more time thinking about securiting money and income.
 And health, of course.
 Minimize social media usage? Its addicitve but not entirely obviously cnstructi
ve, except that it is an information channel that does provide information;
 its the primary push-notification system that I use.
 (In the abstract sense: social media pushes news to me; I don't have to
 hunt for it.
 Same way that newspapers and TV of old were push systems, and libraries
 were pull systems.)

Create a text-reader-node, an IRC-node, a twitter-reader-node.
 Provide a way of hooking these to the LG parse node.
 Provide a matrix node, to move the matrix code into C++.
 I suppose it should be more tensor-like, but maybe the pairs are ok, since
 disjuncts+shapes seems to be a workable paradigm.
 The text-reader+LG should overcome the pipeline paralleizability problems?
 This then opens the possibility for up/down-regulation.
 And even for configuring the pipeline itself in atomese.
 In other words, baby steps on the current path.
 Nothing I've learned yet suggests a need to change direction.
 Am I just missing some bigger picture? What would be a better direction,
 a more productive direction?

\begin_layout Standard
Processing: There are three mechanisms.
 One is the ValueStream system.
 It's kind of hard to hook up; its kind of hard to get the triggers running
 correctly, The basic demos work, the grand vision is OK I guess, but croaked
 when I tried to use it for LG processing.
 I forget what went wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another system is the StorageNode and ProxyNode system.
 Works great, if your dataflow can be mapped to the provided API.
 So, great for moving and saving atoms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third system is the CogServer.
 Open a telnet socket, and interact, in arbitrary ways.
 One of these is to send it Atoms, which then typically trigger processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can we convert the word-pair counting subsystem into a sensory-input subsystem?
 Where, rather than feeding it data, it pulls data? We could write a C++
 node to read data, but the bottleneck is the scheme-based matrix API for
 counting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current pipeline is crazy: ./pair-submit.sh calls process-corpus.sh calls
 file-block-process.sh calls submit-block.pl calls netcat (observe-block-pairs
 "string") which is (make-block-pair-observer) which accepts TEXT-BLOCK
 and calls (make-pair-counter matrix-count-api) for a pre-configured matrix
 api object that counts things into the appropriate locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there are three or four meta-issues, here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The pipeline is a push pipeline (obviously) and we want a pull pipeline,
 and the bottleneck to that is the matrix API, which prevents onboarding
 into the AtomSpace proper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The complexity of it all.
 Hard-wired processing.
 Somehow we want to decrease the complexity.
 Part of the shell-script complexity was the desire to have it be highly
 configurable, but this is mostly not needed.
 It gives the illusion of configurability, but the need to configure is
 lost in the mists.
 Almost no options matter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Not entirely clear how that complexity abates, if it is moved to the AtomSpace.
 It might simply get more encapsulated: C++ code does complex things.
 Then blobs of atoms do overall control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Motivational drives still unclear.
 The project seems to be a hand-coding of a small agent (or set of agents)
 capable of ingesting text and processing it.
 And then what? What makes this better than any other agent framework?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scaling.
 Hand coding is wrong.
 It primes the pump, but its wrong.
 How do we scale? An older conventional dream (disclaimer: not for an instant
 did I beleive this) was to build a system that knows how to code, then
 it would self-code itself.
 Can LLM's do this? Seems no: they are wordcels, not shape rotators.
 Mimics understanding, grasps basic syntax, doesn't understand the point
 of it all.
 My goal here is to build a shape rotator.
 So the AGI 2022 paper explains the path to understanding shapes, via disjuncts.
 But its clear I need to refocus on agentic activity.
 This provides an opportunity to ask: should I discard current code base
 and try something else? But I hit the conventional wall there.
 Sure, deploying docker containers on the cloud is agentic, but the cloud
 tools are designed for humans so that they can deploy containers.
 They're not designed for agents to do agent things.
 So I keep coming back to thinking there's no viable alternative to the
 AtomSpace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except for one thing: mindshare.
 There are thousands, tens of thousands of people looking at, working on
 pop AI projects, and zero working on opencog.
 I'd like to get more mindshare, but I also don't see a path forward with
 these other projects.
 So I'm stumped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One alternative is to stop crafting my own system, and to become an influencer.
 But there are so many influencers, and the vast majority of them are wrong.
 Another course of action is to work into a position of being cheif architect
 or lead reasearcher at a place that has money, but this is hard, and is
 a multi-decade project, so my time is up, for that.

Some people still seem to wonder why Putin has attacked Ukraine.
 There's a reason.
 It's rather simple, actually.
 A 🧵 Lets start in the middle.
 Circa 2015.
 Qatar is looking to build a gas pipeline to Europe.
 It would run right through Allepo...
 1/10 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 13, 2022 This is a threat to Gazprom revenues.
 It would liberate Europe from dependence on Russian oil/gas.
 This must be stopped, and so Putin decides to shoot down a Russian jet:
 Flight 9268.
 Initially blaming ISIS for this, this provides an excuse.
 2/10An excuse to enter the Syrian war.
 To bomb the eff out of Aleppo.
 The pipeline is never built.
 Europe remains dependent on Russian oil/gas.
 Now, lets go back a bit earlier, to 2013, when large shale-oil and shale
 gas reserves are found in the Donbas.
 3/10 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 13, 2022 Ukraine already has an immense
 gas pipeline running to Europe, so its a no-brainer to develop those fields.
 Maybe even put Gazprom out of business.
 That would be a huge blow to Putin's revenue stream.
 And so, in 2014, "little green men" appear.
 4/10 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 13, 2022 The little green men, Russian soldiers
 w/o any identifying marks or papers, in league with Donbas separatists,
 wreak havoc.
 Yet, despite these efforts, Ukraine survives and thrives.
 And that's not good.
 Not good for Putin.
 See, the problem is ...
 5/10 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 13, 2022 Russians might notice just how
 well the Ukrainians live.
 Much better if they saw something that looks like, oh, I dunno - South
 Ossetia, Chechnya, Georgia, places like that.
 Piles of rubble.
 Helps Russians realize just how good they've got it.
 6/10 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 13, 2022 After 2014, Donbas became a dysfunction
al hell-hole.
 Complete with piles of rubble.
 Lets be very very clear about this: the more piles of rubble that Putin
 creates, the more he wins.
 Right now, he is winning bigly.
 He's getting exactly what he wants.
 7/10 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 13, 2022 The price is not too high.
 He's definitely not ready to stop.
 He can bear the cost.
 Heck, Europe pays him $1 billion a DAY, for gas/oil.
 That money covers *all* the military losses.
 Several times over.
 Loss of equipment, soldiers is NOT A PROBLEM.
 8/10 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 13, 2022 None of this should be in the slightest
 mysterious to anyone.
 There are Wikipedia articles detailing everything I've said.
 Oh, and published books.
 Blog posts and analysis galore.
 This is not a mystery.
 Repeat: this is not a mystery.
 9/10 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 14, 2022 For general Russian history, follow
 @TimothyDSnyder .
 For world-class modern Russian literature, straight from Moscow, look up
 #MishaFirer.
 He's a Russian national treasure.

Randy Evanchuk @evanchuk_randy · Jun 18, 2022 Linas.
 Excellent point about Donbas shale resources.
 For Putin it's all about controlling the flow of energy and money.
 He simply cannot operate in a free market.
 If it gets my way, destroy it.
 Linas @linasvepstas · Jun 18, 2022 There's some interesting things about
 his "formative years".
 If I recall correctly, he came from a broken home, hung out with street
 gangs.
 The KGB recruited him from one of the gangs.
 Randy Evanchuk @evanchuk_randy · Jun 18, 2022 Lina's.
 That certainly makes sense.
 Sounds like his childhood and KGB upbringing created an unchecked psychopath.

Quantum speed limits
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, fixing a merge, clarifying ideas.
 Then I took several naps.
 I am now writing here because I'm very excited by an idea, and I have nowhere
 else to express it.
 (Social media is inappropriate for stuff like this, and the idea is too
 fragmentary to become a paper.
 So dear diary, here's what I got ...) Hang on to your butt, it sounds crazy.

The future does not exist.
 Oh well, duh.
 I suppose there are some people that might agree with that statement.
 But its not what I mean.
 Time does not exist.
 Err, well, future time does not exist.
 What? OK, so hang on.
 Let me explain.
 In the simplest example of the quantum speed limit, it is about an inequality
 to the effect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\ge\pi\hbar/2\Delta E$
\end_inset

 as the minimum time for a quantum state to evolve to being orthogonal.
 Not hard to demonstrate.
 The formula that caught my attention, though, was the one for mixed states,
 that required the use of a density matrix formulation.
 In this formula, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{\tau}\sigma_{t}dt\ge D\left(\rho_{0},\rho_{\tau}\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t}=|\psi_{t}\rangle\langle\psi_{t}|$
\end_inset

 is the density matrix, and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is the Bures distance (the Fubini–Study distance for mixed states) and
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a length, an infinitessimal line element, a tangent vector that is the
 rms expectation value of the energy.
 The Hamiltonian, to be more precise: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{t}=\sqrt{\left|\mbox{tr}\rho_{t}H^{2}\right|-\left|\mbox{tr}\rho_{t}H\right|^{2}}$
\end_inset

 which is clearly a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Euclidean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 length element.
 This is a very geometix, Riemannian-geometry kind of statement.
 The Bures distance 
\begin_inset Formula $D\left(\rho_{0},\rho_{\tau}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a geodesic length between to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 on some (infinite-dimensional) manifold: its the minimal length between
 these two points (its infinite-dimensional even for a cubit, because the
 mixture forces this: the Bures distance is defined on the sigma-algebra
 of classical probabilities on the quantum state, and sigma-algebras are
 generically infinite dimensional, because there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=2^{X}$
\end_inset

 subsets of a space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 Whatever, you know what I mean.) The Bures distance is a geodesic length,
 a minimal length that is stationary under variation (Euler–Lagrange, etc.
 of Riemannian geometry.) Meanwhile, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{t}$
\end_inset

 is just some tangent vector, parameterized by a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, along some other curve between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, and so of course, the length 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{\tau}\sigma_{t}dt$
\end_inset

 of any other curve is going to be longer (duh) than the minimal geodesic
 length.
 This is just entirely normal Riemannian geometry.

 Except it is the time, because by convention, that is what it is called,
 because this is QM after all, and 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the Hamiltonian.
 But what this is really saying is ...
 well, if you, dear reader, are a sceptic, you could just say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

duhh this is just textbook physics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But is you are more interpretive, you could say that the future is open,
 undetermined, there is an evolving dynamical system, tracing out a geometric
 path along some manifold, with a future undetermined, except by the governing
 dynamics of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 In this sense, the

: rather one has some point

 and it is dynamically, even kinematically moving about.
 This was the flash of insight.
 And it feels like an important break-through.
 Something I've been trying to grasp, struggling for decades, and there
 it is, finally laid bare: the key, the missing link, thefinal bit of evidence
 to tie it all together.
 it's weird, its hard to communicate the insight, because this is, in some

The things about the quantum speed limit.
 First (and I don't quite understand this) but in the XY-model of a thermal
 bath of spins in a magnetic field, there's apparently a phase transition
 governed by the magnetic field: below the critical value, the quantum speed
 is as given above (where the speed is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\Delta t$
\end_inset

 of course), while above the critical point, it is at maybe 1.6 of that value,
 but as it passes through the transition (this is https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08023
 
\emph on
Quantum speed limits: from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to optimal
 quantum control
\emph default
, Sebastian Deffner, Steve Campbell, figure 4 page 31) where the speed becomes
 infinite at the critical point.
 What does this mean? I interpret this (and maybe incorretly) that, at this
 point, the quantum state can change very rapidly from one configuration
 to another, and that this can serve as a model of quantum wave-function
 collapse: a selection of one state out of a superposition of many, because
 that callapse can happen at infinite speed (because it is at the critical
 point) and it divorces itself from the superposition (because critical
 points/phase transitions do exactly that, generically.) In a sense, the
 state of the thermal bath and the influences 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

test particle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 avalanches, from a superposition to a collapsed state.
 This is novel (for me) because it combines conventional QM with many-particle
 dynamics in a familiar way to solve what is otherwise an aggrevatingly
 mysterious problem of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave-function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Wow! Huh! So now we've got a plausible model, a mechanical, dynamical,

how/why
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 wave function collapse happen: as an

\end_inset

infinite speed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 evolution of a wave function from a superposition to just one possibility,
 discontinuous, in the standard sense of a discontinuity in a first-order
 phase transition.
 That, and bonus round, because in the XY model, its dealing with spins,
 not bosons, and we want spins (not bosons) because everythig is spins;
 in the sense that the spin connection on a Riemannian manifold is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

origin story
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of why we have fermions in the first place.
 So it all fits togethe, very nicely.

 this is a diary entry and not a formal paper.

\begin_layout Standard
The other thing about the quantum speed limit is the Bremermann–Bekenstein
 limit.
 The Bekenstein bound is about the minimal surface area of a blob of entropy.
 The Bremermann limit is this quantum speed limit, of how quickly that informati
on can be propagated.
 Putting these two together, one has a limit for how quicky information
 can be extracted across a boundary of space.
 The magic is that Hawking radiation exactly saturates that bound: Hawking
 radiation is emitted at the maximal rate allowed by the quantum speed limit
 (across the bounding horizon.) Is that cool, or what?

 to be wrong, its just an algebra trick) then we have that spacetime is
 infalling at the speed of light at the horizon.
 But as there's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we have instead that there's a density matrix sitting in its own private
 idaho (its own fierbein) evolving at the horizon, at the quantum speed
 limit, and thanks to entanglement, that evolving system is entangled with
 the external world, and the speed/rate of that entanglement is given by
 the Bremermann–Bekenstein limit.
 But the point is that it is a mixture, a mixed state, a density matrix
 ...
 a sigma algebra of possibilities, each evolving as the usual conventional
 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\rho}=-i\left[H,\rho\right]$

 The point is that the dot is a tangent vector, and 
\emph on

 a time derivative, even though 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

it looks like time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the conventional standpoint.
 That is differentials are not the same thing as derivaitves, although confusion
 between the two is justified.
 Differentials are geometrical objects, whereas derivatives are about change
 in time.
 So where were we ...
 at the event horizon, we've got this sigma algebra capable of carrying
 a (trace-class) density matrix.
 That density matrix is entangled with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

external
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 world; that entanglement rate is precisely the Hawking radiation, and the
 dynamical system outside the horizon evolves according to the Mandelstam–Tamm
 limit-speed, with the occasional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

wave function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 thrown in for good measure, as needed.
 But there is no time (no future).
 Because, well, hmm.
 and its all covariant.
 Hmm.
 What happens inside a black hole? Well, the density matrix is evolving
 there as well...
 its just as entangled there, as anywhere else.
 And for all of this to make sense, to be coherent, it has to be entangled
 to the external world, as well.
 Conclude: there is no firewall.

How would this entanglement work? We have Alice and Bob and their Bell experimen

 It's done for, The evaporation argument is that eventually, that information
 evaporates back out, even though Bob and his instrument have long been
 crushed at the singularity.
 (well, OK, if its rotating then ...
 whatever.) The density matrix, it was ...
 always, uhh, hmm.
 The information was never lost, because...
 Hmm.
 OK, well, clearly, this part remains opaque.
 I don't get it.
 (The rotating black hole is appropriate, if for no other reason than that
 the river model implies that the interior of the place hole should be thought
 of as carrying a spin connection, which is everythwere rotating.
 which is what we want, anyways...)

 The one thing we can't do is to prove that its the same, because poor Bob
 and his instrument got whacked.
 So really, this is not about black holes per se, but how wave function
 collapse works when the entangled states are on opposite sides of an event
 horizon.
 To answer that question, we do need a mathematical model of the shot-noise-like
 collapse, the many-body quantum-speed-limit phase transtion thingy.
 Once we have that, we can then go look at what happens in each distinct
 fierbein, even as some of these are on oppisite sides of a horizon ...
 well ..
 if there's no time, but spacetime is covariant, then we have issues in
 what it means to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

an intertial frame

 because no time means that time is emergent from the dynamics of the dynamical
 system.
 So we have to deal with that.

Oh, and for the first time in my life, I'm realizing that, well, I don't
 have ADHD and I'm not on the autism spectrum, never have never will, but
 gee, when I read about th=ese things, well perhaps I am.
 Sometimes I have trouble having a conversation because I have so many different
 things I could say, such a large direction of choices in conversational
 gambits, that its hard to pick only one.
 Its not quite overwhelming or debilitating, but it can be eneergy scking,
 and its easier to sit quietly and say nothing at all, and relaz, rather
 then spend the energy and contort and work hard to narrow down, to focus,
 to collapse the possibilities in front of me to only the one or two things
 that can be purused in a conversation.
 This is all very metaphorical, is it not?

 The hitch-hikers guide had a prescient observation: you have no future
 when you have no choices.
 Death is when your range of choices narrows to nothing at all, when you
 can no longer move, can no longer act.
 Choiceless mode.
 So i'm not autistic or ADHD, but its ineresting that I can empathize with
 the symptoms.
 I guess I'm in denial, is what that would mean.
 I wonder what taking ritalin would be like.
 Fuck.
 Even now, I have so many thoughts, it is hard to figure out which one to
 write about, there are just so many things I could writ about here.
 It's overhwelming.
 I can't type fast enough, and even if I could type fast-enough, the single-stre
am-of-conscioiusness precludes tackling all at the same time.
 So instead, my thoughts are like a one-dimensional curve threading densly
 through a packed space of ideas, trying to hit on all of them.
 Playing the piano incoherently, trying to make piano chords as fast as
 possible, hit every note, ergodically, chaotically.
 All this is relevant to opencog as well, see the last umpteen commits to
 this git repo.
 the fuck.
 I'm doing too much, to little, spending my time stupidly on dead-end projects
 and unatainable goals, but itts fun cause its got the psychological flow,
 and I'm fully vested with the irreponsible, impulsive flighty imagination
 of the ADHD which allows me to be creative and do anything I feel like
 without focusing.
 Impulsivity is the word I was looking for.
 Impulsive writing in the diary.
 I vowed to do this much more often, but I haven't because ..
 because waht? Because writing is a chore, writing is alsow draining, even
 if I'm writing a word salad as fast as I can type.
 I mean, it helps to write things down, in a way it helps.
 These are all ideas I would have anyway (or past tense: ideas I have had;
 I am only documenting them here, not creating them.) And documentation is
 immortalization, inscription into the fabric of the universe, and well,
 honestly, most of the crap Ive written over they years, I've completely
 forgotten.
 Sometimes, I find old stuff I wrote and I go

Linas @linasvepstas · 58m Don't put cart before the horse.
 There's already bots all over twitter & youtube; they're currently semi-automat
ed, overseen by handlers.
 There are OSINT groups that track them and provide operational overviews:
 how they work, who runs them, how many there are.
 ...
 thread 1/2 If you want to start a bot network, start small.
 Figure out what you want the bots to talk about, who you want them to talk
 to, how, why.
 Monitor closely to see if the conversation is going off the rails, and
 if so, why.
 ...
 2/N Start with something tame, say flat-earth or Atlantis on youtube, and
 work out how to convince someone that the Earth isn't actually flat.
 Realize that you're not just talking one-on-one, but there's an entire
 audience reading comments.
 How's the audience taking it? ...
 3/N Are you getting upvotes? Downvotes? Getting blocked by original poster?
 Getting mocked? Some big chunk of the space-aliens-from-Egypt-Atlantis
 crow is going to be IQ 75 to 95 range, the conversations will be very incoheren
t.
 How can you track progress? ...
 4/N I've had these conversations.
 They're actually very hard.
 You have to kind of crawl-up inside the head of the other person, and figure
 out what they're thinking, before you can respond effectively.
 If you can't figure out what they're thinking, communication is hard.
 ...
 5/N Do we have LLM's that can build coherent mental models of what's going
 on inside someone else's head? I don't think so...
 How do you build a persuasive chatbot, if the chatbot can't do that? ...
 6/N Look at the KGB/FSB chatbots ...
 they're semi-automated, sometimes you interact with a real human.
 The human isn't capable of holding up their end of an argument.
 (Try it, if you haven't.) So mostly they flood the channel with bad takes.
 7/N Flooding the channel with bad takes is rather ineffective, but they
 don't need much: just hit 1% of the MAGA #1A #2A #ifbap #njf #FJB patriots
 and sway the elections; its all they want.
 That's the current state-of-the-art (but pre-LLM) technology.

 you do it as a single, individual human? How can you offload that to an

17 April 2024 – Design Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I was going to write design notes and the free unrescricted flow of words
 randomlly into this diary, without having to convince the reader (or even
 myself) of the correctness of what is to come is just so much more fun.
 I'll try to be semi-focused here, with fewer constraints than formal design
 notes, but not complete vapid free-flowing blech.
 Although the free flow ...
 I self-diagnosed myself as having mild ADHD last week.
 Apparently, I have so many different thoughts about so many different things
 that it is hard to focus, and to place just one thought into the forefront,
 where there are so many competing others.
 Such a vast array of choices before me: places to go! Things to do! Yet
 clearly ADHD is widespread, so I am describing a mundane mental state which
 afflicts many if not most people.
 What's odd that this has entered into my conscious lived, rememebered experienc
e for the first time.
 I may have noticed it before, but have nevr commited such notes as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and assigned them to long-term memory.
 Seems that I have something else here: the conscious choice to commit thigs
 to long-term memory: most thoughts come and go, without such priviledge.
 Curious in how I am more self-aware of my own mental processes.
 ...
 Or am I? Was I always aware of them, even younger, but only now becoming
 more interested in exploring, shaping, tumbling them? Nah.
 When I was younger, I'd just ..
 do stuff, and maybe post-rationalize later.
 The ability to focus was a talent I was born with; I'd been doing focused
 thought since as long as I can rememeber, even three years old, I was aware
 of focusing to acheive a purpose (stacking blocks, in that case: first
 time ever I was able to stack blocks, and not have them fall over.
 I was 3 or 4; my sister was there, and she could not do that, even though
 I tried to show her how.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enough with these distractions.
 Or is it? A general issue with the distractions is prioritizing activities:
 what's more important: to do what I'm doing now (writing this) or do what
 I intended to do (wriate about alternative openocg/atomspace designs)?
 The act of writing here is in turn a distraction from yet other rather
 pressing issues I should be dealing with.
 I have a long list of stuff that needs to be squeezed out, and like many
 (most?) folks I procrastinate.
 Why? Doing the things I don't want to do is painful.
 Like psychically painful, sometimes it gives rise to headaches.
 Sticking in the flow is so much easier and more fun, and for me, doing
 science/math/programming is the flow.
 I can ignore the entire exterior world as I pursue the glorious mental
 quest here, in these words & pages, in the text and software I've written,
 in the artwork and music I once created as teenager.
 The so-called creative-class that enjoys what they do so much, and pines
 away to be paid for it.
 A few lucky youtubers do manage to pull this off.
 The rest of us, not so much: caught in a trap of having to live the regular

I just got up to get another cup of coffee (I'm still in the morning wake-up
 phase) and had another ahlf-dozen thoughts on the way to the kitchen and
 back, all meeting the threshold notability requirements for being included
 in this diary, since I have no threshold requirements for notability.
 Antyhing goes in this diary, that's the rules, spelled out at the very
 begining.
 The issue is that I can think much much faster than I can type and vocalize:
 the fleeting ides happen faster.
 Also, the device that converts ides into grammatically correc sentence
 constructions kind of interferes or degraes the idea-generation capacity;
 its kind of hard to think and vocalize at the same time.
 So when I am typing away like crazy, I am aware of a seeming paucity of
 thoughts.
 Like streams of thought come to an end and die, or never go anywhere, or
 the barest hint of an idea slips through the mental fingers, even as th
 text-generation module comes up with cliver little expressions like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

institutional terms

istics voyage.
 I learned them, but only because other linguists have introspected and
 explored, and set theier findings into words, texts, published papers where
 their ideas could be found, explored, discussed, accepted or rejected,
 until 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

set phrase
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes common knowledge and an accepted idea in the broader community.
 So, a meme, of sorts, occupying many minds as a usefully valid concept.
 How odd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BTW, the above joins up very nicely to the general mememtic framework ideas
 that I write about on my (now abandoned) blog, in various writings, in
 some twiter posts, and perhaps earlier here in my diary; I have no particular
 memroy of what I've commited to this text, so it might be possible that
 I repeat myself.
 Ideas and concepts as memes that spread between human minds, that occupy
 significant postions of the civilizational awareness: thousands, tens of
 thousands of minds at once.
 (The are jigsaws in how they fit together, thats the recurring seach term.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have not noticed that there's a scaling law before, Well, I have, but
 perhaps not given it appropriate weight.
 Let me say it again, let me verbalize.
 Some ideas are entirely prive: exist only in one person.
 Of those ideas, some are only fleeting and evaporate; other ideas are strongly
 hel;d, but are held private (for example: e.g.
 criminal acts of that particular person: a strong vivid experience that
 mostly cannot be shared due to criminal represussions.
 Excpetions: OJ, in the years after his acquittal.) I digress.
 Other ideas are held by dozens, less than hundreds, say, fro example, some
 of the more obscure ideas in string theory: something that might be presented
 to a small audience in Princeton IAS, ideas developed by one author, appreciate
d by dozens, and then maybe forgetten or maybe not.
 Other concepts, like the word-piar 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

institutional phrase
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is understood by throusands of lingusits, perhaps tens of thousands of
 those who are interested, perhaps hundreds of thousands of college students
 who fully grokked the idea in class.
 And so on: Everyone in Lithuania understands certain sterotypically Lithuanian
 cultural aspects (say, myths, nursery rhymes, etc.) I use Lithuania not
 America here because America culture os global dominating: everyone knows
 who the Simpsons are: Bart Simpson decals show up on Ukrainian drone munitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there's this idea that some ideas are widespread, and occupy man human
 brains, while others are narrow, say things only musicians know: and even
 then there are things most misicians know, and things few musicians know.
 So to each concept there is a number we can assign: what fraction of the
 population knows this thing.
 The number is dynamical, and changes over time (duh.) we'lll get back to
 flat earth theory shortly.
 There are other numbers: how much room an idea occupies in one skull.
 For example, the wor 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: everyone knows it, I almost never think about it (I suppose firement think
 about it a lot) I have a dozen memories of campfires, and dozens more of
 things buring, from twigs to stoves, from barbeques to News at Nine TV
 shots of burning warehouses.
 So lot to be aware about fire, but it is very much filed away in a dusty
 corner of my mind, in the dusty corners of everyone's minds (there goes
 my language-generator apparatus again: it decided that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dusty corner
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was a good way to express the idea.
 That was not me that came up with this phrase, it was my trusty langauge
 generator.
 I approvied of this wording choice as being accurate, and did not interrupt
 to try to find a better phrase.
 Sometimes I have to stop, interrupt, to force the langauge center to come
 up with something better, because the current wording choice was so fucking
 lame.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fucking lame
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? That's another set phrase, but I redigress circularly here, Cut the loop.
 Cut the knot, Onwards through the fog, as Oat Willie would say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I numbers and sizes of ideas/concepts.
 We have: (a) how many human minds does a given idea occupy? (b) how much
 of a single human mind does it occupy, e.g.
 a dusty corner, like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or as an object of obsession? Is the idea even just fleeting? (c) connectivity.
 Does the idea (c1) connect well with other humans/society/culture, and
 (c2) does it connect well with the personal memplex? (e.g.
 conceptions of flat earth, held by a single individual, vs.
 conceptions of flat earth held by the community of beleivers).
 What other scaling laws do we have?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so my littlle mental ball once again falls into the grooves of well-warn
 mental pathways: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its a a mememtic memplex network, and we are to study network connectivity
 properites
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but like everyone knows this, everyone whose looked at memplexes.
 Connectivity is explained with jigaw pieces.
 This gets a remarkably hostile reception.
 Very few people seem open to this, and yet it seems to be a central mathematica
l building block, for me.
 And more: the jigsaws are tensor products of their connectors ...
 mostly tensor products...
 Hmm as I write this it occurs to me that perhaps I need a bit of both.
 That is, most numbers are assigned to the jigsaw, and are properties of
 that jigsaw, and so writing 
\begin_inset Formula $j=c_{1}\otimes c_{2}\otimes\cdots$
\end_inset

 is the appripriate notatation for a jigsaw, because that is what tensor
 products do: linearity.
 But other times, (and far less frequently) I need to assign numbers/properties
 to individual connectors.
 So I need somehting semi-associative, for that.
 And, well, I guess I've got that too.
 Just that I've never noticed it before: the lin-grammar experssions are
 this: they do allow expressions like 
\begin_inset Formula $j=c_{1}\otimes\left(c_{2}\oplus c_{3}\oplus\cdots\right)\otimes c_{4}\otimes\cdots$
\end_inset

 where the oplus is the disjunctive choice, of course, but I can.
 well I'm going in circle here.
 This is always aand again the same round of ideas, good valid ideas which
 is why I keep plugging away at the atomspace & the learn project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What else can one do? I guess I should read more about LLM's and high-diimension
al vector spaces because they do dominate.
 But the jigsaw model seems like the only thing.
 Perhaps my obsession with it blinds me to other ideas from the LLM world?
 I don't think so.
 Jigsaws are the way to go, for AGI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So at last we circle back: I need an agential model, the current batch processin
g framewwork sucks.
 And so I need a generator.
 I attempted the opencog/generate thing but it was designed as an odometer
 and does not scale.
 It has all the combinatorial issues of ergodic exploration of space.
 Then there's the link-grammar generator, which is much too crude, as it
 is founded on word-sequence ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need a generation fast-path.
 I need a system with the following properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hookup to chatbot, for output.
 The IRC api will do for now; there are also javascript chat i/o api's that
 look nicer but are more complex, and won't be prusued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The most minimal generator, for the most minimal data.
 This is clearly the word-pair high-MI crawler.
 This is written as scheme code stapled into that graphical explorer thingy.
 Attaching scheme code for high-MI word pairs to IRC seems very counter
 productive, what I really want is to do this in Atomese.
 Why Atomese? Because Atomese gives me an API that ...
 that what, exactly?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fuck bullet points.
 Maybe later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue with scheme code is that it is fragile: fragile engineering, hand-craf
ted human code, of increasing complexity and bugginess.
 I want to get away from that.
 Atomese seems like the way to go, but is it? Well, it has major faults:
 first, I am stil hand-writing and engineering code that is buggy and fragile.
 Worse, it is a language that no one knows: only me, and that's kind of
 it.
 There's this vague feeling in the back of my mind that the Atomese API's
 are somethow more fluid and more forgiving and can be mashed about more
 easily than regular programming lgnagues, but is that bunkum, or not?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So lets work through some example cases: Write (hand-write aka engineer)
 some Atomese to export chains of word-pairs.
 Just a very short time later, I want to replace those high-MI chain constraints
 with jigsaw constraints (when I get some jigsaws available throuugh counting.)
 As explained, I think writing this in scheme, as engineered code, is wrong,
 but how do I mount a defense that it is acceptable for writing it in Atomese?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old hand-waving answer was to use MOSES to perform random sampling of
 assemblages, and to use evolutionary selection of fitter demes, and to
 evolve under evolutionary pressure.
 There are two or three problems here.
 One is that evolutionary selection is effing slow: that is what the LLM's
 have taught us: the LLM's are much faster, bettter stronger than the random-for
est models of MOSES.
 Why? Because the gradient descent algos provide multiple benefits: scalability
 to large sizes, locality of gradient descent, through the backprop algo,
 which maps onto GPU's soo nicely.
 I have no backprop algo for MOSES trees.
 I need to have one to get performance.
 So that's one major huge issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue is its not clear what the reinforcement scheme is, what the
 training regimine is.
 For LLM's its clearly defined: prediction of long-range word correlations
 in huge training corpora.
 But a chatbot has not this.
 A free agent readding books, however, could train in this way.
 So by this argument, access to training corpora is not a problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets return to the core issue: I've written some hand-code in Atomese for
 stringing together word pairs, now I want to replace it by Atomese for
 assembling jigsaw pieces.
 Is there any reasonable way in which I could entrust MOSES to generating
 that code? Perhaps I should hand write the first iteration, and let MOSES
 somehow tune it? Since I don't know what the underlying structure is, I
 don't yet know if MOSES can find tunable parameters in there.
 I also don't know if the tunability can be recast into backprop style algos.

 Atomese is too slow, I can't affort to reinvent all the code that Amir
 has optimized, so I kind of need an LG-based assembler.
 However, the current API's are missing and wrong, so assembly will require
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the level above this? There's a fork in the road, and this is where
 things are murky.
 The LLM's predict word sequences, and wahtever inner structure they have,
 it is murky.
 I beleive much of that inner structure is explainable as weighted LG expression
 tensors/disjuncts/connectors, but I'm not prepared to engage in a research
 program to pursue that.
 It would be a huge research program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current LG language/semantics-as syntax program hits a wall at entity
 recognition.
 This is BTW, the same wall that LLM's hit: the LLM's seem not to be able
 to abstract and obtain the concept of an entity.
 They hallucinate crazy-ass shit cause they don't have a (strong, coherent)
 model of entities.
 My AGI 2022 papers talk about how to obtain visual entities through jigsaws,
 but the development there is shallow.
 I've had some naive daydreams about tntity recognition, starting with the
 observation of recurrance ...
 and then I put those ideas on hold, because my current software framework
 is too fragile, insufficiently developed to reach up into there.
 And so here I am back about talking about pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So let me sketch the vauge idea.
 When one writes a long essay, a long philosphical tract, one is performing
 an ergodic, space-filling exploration of a region of conceptual noosphere
 surrounding some collection of topics.
 One linearizes this path into a string of words.
 One uses grammar to get words into agreeement, and then one uses anaphora
 to stitch things together at the multi-sentence scale.
 The stitiching together at the multi-paragraph scale comes from coneptual
 entities, where a word used in one paragraph is meant to refer to the same
 concept/idea in another paragraph: so not anaphora, cuase its the same
 word.
 But sometimes synonymous words are used, synonymous phrasing.
 For the listener, the slistener must detect that synonymy, and they can
 do that only if they are well-read and familiar with the Western corpus
 of literature and writing.
 Even pop culture: there are things I don't recognize becyase they're pop
 culture that I missed.
 So pop culture is constatntly creating and attaching meaning with synonymizing
 expressions.
 But I keep returing to one idea here: pairs.
 Edges.
 Thing A linked to thing B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So yes, in some sense, I'm always thinking about pairs.
 Word pairs with high MI is the staring point.
 The ergodic crawl over pop culture is an edge walk, a walk from concept
 to concept to concept, along edges.
 The expression of an edge might actually be a paragraph or two, instead
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just a pair of words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but the exporation is still an edge walk, a pair walk.
 So the underlying foundation of a graph, of jigsaws, of Bayesian-prioer
 possible worlds of possible jigsaw assemblies, that all still seems valid
 and correct, and the thing to work on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, I do not yet have the full software stack to reach what I'm saying
 here.
 It seems like I'm close, I'm, on the right track, but fucktons of work
 remain.
 And life is short and progress is slow and I need money/income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what can I conclude? I need the word-pair generator.
 I need it in Atomese.
 And maybe later, someday soon, I can find an appropriate LG-codebase API
 for disjunct/expression assembly.
 I can defer that until later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That leaves two fresh and relatively unexplored topics: the agential viewpoint
 and the i/o subsystem.
 For i/o, I need to pump those words out to somehwere, and I don't yet have
 a clear idea of what that API is.
 It the high level, I want to take a pair of concepts, and articulate them
 into paragraphs.
 At the low level, I was to spew words into bytes that will appear on an
 IRC channel, or perhaps be sent to a javqascript web-page.
 What's the commen API for these two? What's the Atomese API for these two?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The agential thing is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what's the gent?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 aka attention allocation, the meta issue of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what should I do now, as an agent, as opposed to doing something else
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? For now, this is hand-coded: do word-pair counting for a while, then do
 MPG parsing at the same time, then do abstraction into grammatical categories,
 all at the same time, and then do entity recogniziton (which is the level
 I'm at the verge of being able to do, but have gotten knocked back because
 the lower layers are too fragile and immature for that.
 At least, when using the batch-processing approach: the batches risk geting
 fucked.
 The unified stream approach allows the entity recogniztion code to start,
 even as word-pairs are being perceived.
 That basically, entity recogniziton is just MPG parsing at the highly abstracte
d level.
 That this is the entire pipeline, that its scalably recursive, and that
 the thing holding me back is that although diea idea is scalably recursive,
 the actual code base is not.
 Round and round we go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what have we concluded for the short term? I need output to file, and
 I need a word-pair generator in Atomese.
 Maybe I need an IRC interface.
 maybe for demoes to people.
 Maybe I need a javascript chat interface because people seem to like browser
 pages, even though this is harder and clunkier and suckier for the task
 at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the word-pair generator be pure naive Atomese, or should we start
 using LG for that? I might be able to decisde that if I go silent, instead
 of writing a bunch of text.
 Hmm...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK back to words, now that I've gotten started.
 The AtomSpace contains words, and edge pairs, and the incoming set is a
 fst way of finding all edges attached to a word.
 Lets side-track to scalability: should one explore *all* edges, assign
 them a weight, and then pick one to move forward with? Goving over all
 of them (in the abstract) seems not very scalable.
 On the otther hand, no word has so many edges that this isn't an outrageous
 thing to do.
 There is also a sclable-ish algo: randomly select from the large outdoing
 set, create a smaller set of edges, which are now called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the edges in attentional focus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and exhaustively go over all of those.
 This requies the construction of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attentional focus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with a word A, use incoming set to randonly select some subset
 of all possible edges.
 This will be called the "focus set" or the "attentional focus".
 Because it is small, it can be exhaustively iterated and sorted into high-to-lo
w MI order.
 This provides a weighted distribution, from which a rescaled uniform-random
 choice can be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attentional focus set can be understood to be a collection of possible
 universes, a collection of Bayesian priors.
 Instead of choosing a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

most likely future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we will instead draw randomly from these priors (given the prior weighting)
 to chose the next word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How would we implement this in atomese, and how with LG? lets do LG first,
 since it has sharp API boundaries with nasty performance impedance mis-matches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, random sample N from incoming set.
 This is a localized pattern match, though, as we explicitly want to select
 certain edges, beased on a pattern filtering.
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

any
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 edges, or somehting else.
 We could use the pattern engine to do this.
 This requires two pattern engine enhancements:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Return no more than N results.
 We already kind-of have this with the queing, but have not practical way
 of stopping the search because although the code is thread-safe, we don't
 have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

give up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signal to send backwards through the chain.
 Don't have a way of interrupting/halting if its gone on too long.
 But OK, whatever, this is, for now a futuristic concern.
 I think? Performance tuning might say otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A way of randomizing incoming link traversal.
 Well, we kind of have that, the incoming link traverser is a callback,
 and that callback could be replaced by some randomizing selector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But for traversal, the pattern matcher is overkill? Or not? The task here
 is to do chaining: to chain something but only if the chain has a certain
 particular form.
 At the super-high level, the chaining will have to be a syntacitically-correct
 chain.
 But we are not there yet, and the pattern matcher is not exactly what we
 want to use for syntactic analysis, anyway.
 Hmm.
 That's interesting.
 I never thought of the pattrn matcher in this way, before.
 It was always a recursive template matcher.
 But the recursion was always exhaustive, and the whole point of LG is that
 it uses fancy-ass algos for pruning and etc to make that fast, instead
 of being exhaustive.
 Can I flip this on it's head, and use LG for the query engine? How would
 that work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets waste some time on this.
 A given pattern matcher clause is kind of like a disjunct.
 The appearance of a variable in a query clause should be interpreted as
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this variable is a connector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, err...
 sort of.
 Not really.
 actually, the inverse: a single variable occurring in multiple clauses
 should be understand as an equality, an equals-sign equating those locations,
 and everything that is NOT a variable is...
 is...
 is the thing that must 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connect to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 some spot in the atomspace.
 But this is a trivial way to form a connection, so ...
 the point of the variables is tht they are not known, and tier appearence
 in multiple clauses is a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

theory of equality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 applied to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, how does this get reformulated into an LG type system? The fixed
 parts of a clause are ...
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 ...
 well, there's some analogy here.
 I can sense that it is an important (very important??) insight, but it
 is not obvious just yet.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
:{{reply to |Chjoaygame}} OK, so here goes.
 The conventional microscopic explanation of pressure is that it is due
 to the velocity of atoms hitting the walls of a box.
 By Newton's law of the conservation of momentum, each collision transfers
 a minute momentum impulse to the wall, generating a force, or a pressure,
 on average.
 All this is still true.
 However, there are more basic questions: where does velocity come from?
 Why do particles move? What is momentum, anyway? Both special relativity,
 and general relativity have something to say about these "more fundamental"
 questions.
 "But wait", you say, "what does general relativity got to do with it?"
 Well, we've got [[Hawking radiation]] for starters, and the [[Unruh effect]],
 it's generalization to accelerated frames of reference.
 The quantum mechanical vacuum appears to be this rather complex thing that
 isn't understood, but in some ways, it behaves like an [[ideal gas]], in
 other ways, like a [[superfluid]] (from the [[RHIC]] results on heavy ion
 collisions, but also because its a superconductor for [[color charge]]).
 This goes back to at least Dirac in the 1930's, 1940's (the [[Dirac sea]]).
 This culminates with Verlinde's ideas about entropic origins of gravitation.
 "But wait", you say, "what does this have to do with ordinary, conventional
 gas in a box?" Well, so again: we have 19th century laws of thermodynamics,
 such as "G = H-TdS" relating the [[Gibbs free energy]] G to the [[enthalpy]]
 H to the [[entropy]] S and these are used happily by chemists and materials
 scientists everywhere to design the latest and greatest metallic alloys
 and petroleum crackers and whatnot.
 So these laws also are "still true", and they seem to say that pressure
 is due to a change in entropy.
 So we've got two ends of a 19th-century stick here: one end of the stick
 is talking about [[ergodicity]], and the other end is talking about the
 fundamental structure of space and time.
 "But wait", you might say, "joining up these two ends is just speculative
 work by over-edumacated theoretical particle physicists" which would be
 true, except the [[arrow of time]] does seem to have something to do with
 [[ergodicity]], the so called "[[second law of thermodynamics]]" that relates
 time to entropy.
 "But wait" you say, "the second law is just an ordinary law." So why then
 is it that entropic forces seem to actually explain plain-old polymers
 in water? And then there's the bridge to particle physics, by means of
 the [[Casimir effect]], which says that a "field", a bunch of waves/particles
 confined by boundaries, cause a force to be exerted on the boundaries:
 a pressure.
 Unlike the ideal gas, you can't explain the Casimir force with an "its
 just the pressure of particles bouncing off the walls", in part because
 this "pressure" depends on the shape (square boxes and round radar cavities
 experience distinct Casimir forces) and on the particles (spin-1/2 particles
 pull inwards, the Casimir force is used to explain [[quark confinement]],
 see the [[chiral bag model]] for details.)

:The current forefront of theoretical physics is in complete befuddlement
 about these seemingly "accidental" relationships between "unconnected"
 ideas.
 No one can quite figure out what it is, but it's got something to do with
 entropy: of the relative arrangement of "things" with regard to other "things",
 and somehow "time".
 Anyone who is complaining about the lack of progress in physics is simply
 asleep at the wheel: there could not be a more exciting time in physics,
 than now.
 Physics today is much like physics at the end of the 19th century: a bunch
 of disconnected ideas that have some unclear, befuddled relationship with
 each other, but what? This was right before the birth of both quantum mechanics
 and of relativity at the dawn of the 20th century.
 [[Lord Kelvin]] with his "nothing left to be done in physics" speech be

 on [[semi-classical]] (first order in hbar) expansions to quantum gas in
 a box.
 The wave-functions are then explicitly fractal [[space-filling curves]]
 evolving with <math>
\backslash
exp(-iEt/
\backslash
hbar)</math> dynamics, and so have constructive/destructive interference
 (e.g.
 if half of the box is empty, the wave functions are there, but interfere
 destructively, thus "empty").
 I don't know how to relate a space-filling curve into a random walk, but
 it seems that one should be relatable to the other.
 Even if the box is completely empty, one should be able to perform a Casimir
 sum over states, which (I believe) should be equal to the entropic force.
 But I don't know how to do this calculation.

Thermodynamic internal energy is a sum of micro-kinetic energy plus micro-potent
ial energy.
 Potential include chemical, magnetic, nuclear, plus also stress/strain.
 Kinetic is about micro-movement (square of momenta).
 Potential is either about relative location e.g.
 repulsive/attractive forces that depend on location, on its about internal
 degrees of freedom.
 This assume that there are things, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wikipedia: Infraparticle Wikipedia talk: To the best of my incomplete knowledge,
 it can be extended: at least a part of Hawking radiation and of Unruh radiation
 can be understood as the Bremsstrahlung of infraparticles.
 To the best of my knowledge, one can go deeper still, and reinterpret the
 classical polarization density of a charged particle in classical media
 as the vacuum polarization (so that the vacuum looks like "media" and experienc
es conventional "polarization".) The analog of Bremsstrahlung during acceleration
 then becomes plain-old pair creation, (manifesting as Unruh radiation).
 I believe that it is possible for the explanation given in this article
 to be extended to this "polarization density", which gives gives a (semi-)class
ical (non-quantum) explanation to the shedding of soft particle radiation
 in accelerated frames.
 (I call it "non-quantum", because there are no one-loop diagrams, because
 there's no perturbative calculation that is needed to obtain the result.
 You can get this with "tree-level" diagrams, albeit infinite trees, due
 to the infrared divergence.) I do not have references to establish the above,
 but (to the best of my knowledge) this is all "well-known" to people working
 on Unruh/Hawking radiation type stuff.
 I'd love to see the actual calculation, as it would clarify an otherwise
 opaque idea.

Last night, I had a fun dream.
 (Sometimes I wonder if dreams are portals to parallel universes.) It was
 a news magazine, like Newsweek or Time, with a multi-page report on Iran.
 Apparently, several branches of Iranian govt decided to include the US
 in a Greater Islamic Republic.
 Problem is, they hadn't bothered to consult the US about it, nor even the
 Iranian Supreme Court, or other branches of Iranian govt.
 The hardliners were not pleased.
 Oops! It didn't go over well, with recriminations going in all directions.
 But they'd already designed a logo, and printed up letterhead, with a big
 silhouette of the US in the center.
 The reporter seemed to have a lot of fun writing this up, making snide,
 snarky remarks.
 At the end of the article, in fine print, the reporter Zarhed Fakaria,
 notes that the story was written at 2AM and might contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

inaccuracies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Implying joking.
 I thought 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

so that is why you used a pen name? But its obvious: you only swapped the
 initial letter of your first and last name!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (What a good idea: from now on I'm Vinas Lepstas whenever I write something
 dubious that I want to disown.) At the end of the article was a tasteful,
 pretty portrait of an Iranian woman, a drawing or painting.
 She had long straight black hair, combed over in front, with squared-off
 bangs cut so that her hair formed rectangles around her eyes.
 Striking.
 The portrait was a side profile.
 Her nose, prominent, was mirrored in the collar of her shirt.
 I could draw it now.

This dream came from deep in the night.
 I certainly have plenty of late-morning dreams that are very colorful and
 adventurous.
 But the deep-night dreams, they always have more gravitas.

 where I've caught myself debating plot points, picking one, and then having
 the dream to match the plot that I picked.

I've been prattling on about this for years, and no one ever listens.
 So screw it.
 I don't know what formal text to put this into, so its going here.
 Consider a plain-old single-layer neural net.
 Lets assume it has 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 single-bit inputs, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 single-bit outputs.
 Let's assume that its been pre-trained, somehow, and so has an 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N=N^{2}$
\end_inset

-dimensional weight matrix.
 Lets compare this to an equivalent RNN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My basic claim is that an RNN is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

special case
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 NN in which almost all weights have been manually trimmed to be exactly
 zero.
 That is, the input vector 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is chunked into 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 chunks, each one of size 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $N=MK$
\end_inset

.
 An 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 NN is trained, taking a 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

-dimensional input vector, another 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

-dimensional feedback(feed-forward) input, and generates a 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

-dimensional output.
 This requires a 
\begin_inset Formula $2K^{2}$
\end_inset

 weight matrix.
 This is vastly smaller than the starting 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

-dimensional weight matrix, because exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}-2K^{2}=\left(M^{2}-2\right)K^{2}$
\end_inset

 weights are now necessarily zero.
 For almost any 
\begin_inset Formula $M>1$
\end_inset

 this is a large reduction, and it becomes vast, when 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is in the thousands or millions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LSTM's repeat this trick, a second time.
 There's two ways to think about the LSTM.
 The conventional description is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh its just an RNN with more stuff, a feed-through path that can pass data
 through unmolested over long distances (long times).
 The other way to think about it is to say it is a different kind of surgery,
 that again starts with the 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

-dimensional weight matrix, chunks the input and output just like the RNN,
 and (once again) a priori sets almost all of the weights to zero.
 This time, the way the interconnects are eliminated are more clever, so
 that a pass-through path between distant parts of the input is preserved.
 I won't attempt to count the number of weights set to zero, although it
 is still 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(M^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Roughly speaking, it keeps about three times more weights than the naive
 RNN (i.e.
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forget-gate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

input-gate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in addition to the usual weights.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LTSM's have two tricks up their sleeve: both the go/no-go (forget/remember)
 pass-through gate, and also the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adjectival
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 modifier that can alter the data flowing on this long-distance channel.
 I like the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

adjectival
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but this is not industry-standard.
 Perhaps the most interesting aspect is that info gets passed through, unmoleste
d, until there is a very specific piece of evidence that forces a large
 update.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What I'm trying to do with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

learn
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 project is to also trim away almost all weights, except that the trimming
 architecture is 
\emph on
completely different
\emph default
 (and sadly, much more complex.
 Alas.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other peculiar resemblance that has not been adequately articulated
 is that the AtomSpace outgoing/incoming set pointer graph can be thought
 of both as a zero-one weighting and also as a flow graph.
 The calamity is it doesn't work until the sheaf sections are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reinvented
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at a higher layer of abstraction (resulting in a lot or representational
 waste).
 A different problem, highlighted by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

agents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 work, is that signature-representing signatures are hard/awkward and the
 current design seems over-wrought/failing.
 The meta question is: how to (a) simplify the representation of sheaf elements
 (push it deeper into the atomspace) and (b) how to correctly describe signature
-describing signatures.

Dreams, plans, anxiety, fugue states, urgency, importance, planning, flow
 states, decisions, actions, falling asleep, planning, clarity of purpose,
 writing, motivation, careers, the personal past, communications, fond memories,
 wasted youth, regaining youth, focusing on what's important, writing this
 all down to capture the moment, but why, now that I'm awake? Why are these
 things urgent when I fall asleep? Why does my perspective change as I fall
 asleep? Why do I seem to think about the more important things as I drift
 to sleep? They are more important, they sometimes even cause anxiety.
 Resolutions are made, to do things in the morning, resolutions that evaporate
 once morning has arrived.
 Thoughts, like horses, are harnessed in the morning, they make sense and
 go places.
 Thoughts run free at night.
 Why do people drink alcohol? Does it put them in a fugue state that allows
 the thoughts run more freely, the important judgments to rise to the top?
 In the daytime, I am so focused on the flow state, on being creative, here
 and now, in the moment, solving, doing, acting, that I forget about what's
 important.
 I forget to strategize, to plan.
 I've neglected strategizing and planing so long I'm terrible at it; I suppose
 it is something one can do while awake, but not something I do while awake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does one figure things out? I went to a part recently, and at the very
 end, after almost everyone had mostly left, I was talking to a very drunk
 stalwart, who asked me a question, but as I went to answer it, he spewed
 out an idea salad of 15-20 more things, disconnected stream of consciousness,
 and I was unable to answer, because the first thing he mentioned could
 have gotten a 20-minute lecture, and also the second and the third, but
 it just spewed out in a stream, and what could I do but shrug? It was a
 tangle, much like what I write now is a tangle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This idea of tangles I've described it before in this diary, I think: a
 space-filling curve of ideas.
 That it is a somewhat disconnected salad, semi-incoherent, is not so terrible,
 because it does fill the intended intellectual space, and tough titties
 if the yarn does not form a continuous coherent sober stream.
 So there I listened to someones drunken tangle, and gave up, because, well,
 because it was a tangle of mis-perceptions and mis-understandings.
 Amateur theorizing built on an unsolid foundation, and faulty premises.
 It filled a space of ideas, but I did not want to go there, because it
 was factually incorrect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was reading something yesterday, and it was fun to read, sort of, but
 I had to make the decision not to read more, because it went nowhere particular
ly great ore meaningful.
 If I was less articulate or more succinct, I would say that it was, well,
 boring.
 That's a value judgment: I shall do this but not do that.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

boring
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is conveys a not entirely conscious decision.
 When people say boring, they are usually reporting on a spontaneous inner
 subjective state: while sitting in the movie theatre, reading a book, having
 a conversation, suddenly, out of nowhere you realize you are bored.
 Something built up, not by rational deduction, but by a shift of mood,
 a shift of inner perspective, that one's mind had wandered, and whatever
 one was reading/watching, interacting with, it had parted ways and gone
 off to where there was no future for the immediate you.
 Where what you were doing, could do, could think about, could be, was more
 interesting, rewarding, important than this other thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here I am, quietly reproducing a fugue state of falling asleep, except
 in reality I am waking up cause it's morning.
 I'm trying to capture something here in a tangle, and even as I grasp it,
 the point, the important point, the thing I wanted to talk about and think
 about and focus on, has already slipped through my fingers, just as falling
 asleep, one cannot keep focused, but all falls apart into a babble of loosely
 connected ideas or ideas not connected at all.
 So here I am babbling, and I've lost the point, although maybe the point
 was to babble about babbling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What else? What more can I say? Well, lots, I suppose, but its boring.
 I guess that's why I stop writing this diary, instead of trying to write
 every waking hour, because I realize that its all boring, and I have nothing
 to say here to entertain you.
 lalalalalalalala.
 well, perhaps that I have more important tasks to attend to, than to simply
 write.
 Tasks are tasks, things that need to be done.
 The mid-night anxiety are not so much from task lists but from strategic
 decisions that have not been made during waking hours, because strategic
 thinking during waking hours is not done, at least by me.
 Is this why some people are drunk during the daytime? to allow them to
 do strategic thinking, but unharnessing those horses, and letting them
 run free? Or is there a lower, simpler explanation having to do with biological
 addiction? Perhaps its both? How can one ever know? This is a scientific
 question, I suppose, but doing science requires attention and time.
 Attention I can muster in copious abundance, time, as I'm soon to be 65
 years old, appears to be running out, and what I have are just wonders
 of how it is that I ended up here, uncomprehending? Guilt and shame: I've
 had a good life, I'm grateful, most people suffer misfortunes I have evaded.
 Yet, I also wonder about the life that could have been: I've never achieved
 my potential.
 I was capable of doing things, of having a career, of engaging with the
 physical world of power (social power) and force and I never did that.
 I never did that because I was never particularly motivated to.
 Because I never planed or strategized to be great or to achieve something,
 or to accomplish something.
 I never set a goal.
 Mostly never.
 I did set goals to get good at math, and work on AGI, and so here I am
 and have achieved both those goals, to a limited degree, but the question
 is I guess, were those goals worth it? Were there better, more important
 goals? The rich and the powerful, they are held out by society as models
 for great achievement, even as we boo-hiss most billionaires for their
 venal stupidity.
 And this is what I mean: should I have instead followed a path to make
 me rich, powerful, politically engaged? What should I have done, instead?
 Is it too late to have a late-career career change? Is my life, this life,
 is this what it is like to have a crisis of purpose in a post-capitalist
 world where most needs and wants (food, shelter) have been attended to?
 I am lucky, I am unlucky.
 I am the 98th percentile.
 I got it better than 98% I got it worse than 1%.
 That's where I am, and I suppose I should resign to that.
 Yet there is still something nagging.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That nagging thing.
 Well, sometimes it appears as late-night anxiety.
 Sometimes I guess it must appear at other times.
 I'm mostly very good at suppressing anxious thoughts, mostly, but the cost
 is of burying my head in the sand: by suppressing them, I make them go
 away, like closing ones eyes makes things go away.
 The reality of their presence remains unabated.
 I've ducked, I've avoided the issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By writing here, I am also reflexively ducking, avoiding some issue.
 That I could think about more clearly if I didn't try to capture my thoughts
 with keyboard strokes as I thought them.
 But my perseverance would be less.
 If I wasn't pounding the keyboard, my eyelids would be slamming shut, I'd
 be falling asleep, loosing the plot.
 I've had one cup of coffee, but I'm sleepy again.
 Apparently, thinking hard tires me out (I've been noticing this: hours
 of deep thoughts make me sleepy) and even now, I'm not yet fully awake,
 but the mere overwhelming nature of the tangle I am trying to capture in
 words, here, is/has brought down a curtain of fatigue in my brain.
 A little voice screams: go up to bed and lay down and fall asleep, now!
 Or at least the couch! (No more leaning back in the chair for you, that
 sucks, makes butt hurt and back hurt, and its somehow ergonomically bad
 for the heart.
 I can feel it.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even as I battle the urge to go back to sleep I also battle the urge to
 stop writing.
 Why is that? Because what I writ about is important.
 Except its not important.
 At all, and I've said it all before in this diary anyway, so foo, so what
 who cares.
 What's the point of keeping a diary, anyway? There are many answers to
 that.
 Keeping a diary is a luxury, at any rate, I should be doing other things
 instead of writing this.
 Doing a diary is a distraction from those more important things.
 Thinking is tiring and tiresome, yet I can't stop; no living mammal can.
 I think for me, I think for the universe, I wonder what the point of it
 all is.
 I battle a desire to go engage in some other activity that will allow a
 flow state to form, and in that flow state, I will be able to ignore all
 the urgencies of the meaning and hopelessness of life, the hopelessness
 of doing those things that will require 1001 lifetimes, the hopelessness
 of not having an IQ of ten million, of not having the economical and physical
 power of a billionaire: I can't do those things, and see I kind of want
 to, but I can't and so I'm here like an intellectual ant, searching, hunting
 for the opening: where is it? Where do I find it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There have been many diarists before me: many famous ones.
 Who reads diaries, anyway? There have been millions of writers.
 What is one more voice? It feels meaningless, pointless.
 a trite addition to the vast cacophony.
 Many many have written about the cacophony of voices, why the ancient Romans,
 speaking of crowds.
 Caesar, no doubt.
 And what, and what was the point? Caesar lived, died, and is famous for
 having done something or other while alive, and like who cares? What was
 the point? Do I thirst after being able to live the life of Cease, seizing
 each day, and wring from it what is important? And if that is the goal,
 then why have I squandered my life? I studied math, I studied AGI, where
 these false friends? Caesar conquered Mediterranean lands, I conquered
 the noosphere.
 But Caesar never got to the New World, the West.
 Caesar never got to Mars or Jupiter, the nearest star or the furthest corner
 of the Galaxy, like they do in Star Trek.
 I also, will never visit every corner of mathematics explored by man, and
 my lucky and penetration of the unexplored regions is minimal.
 And again, the meta question: should I spend less time writing here, and
 more time doing math? Should I spend less time doing math, and instead
 do something 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

important
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in life, and alas, finally, the nub, the rub: what is important? And so
 I write here, puzzle and wonder, what is important? Why do anything at
 all? In full realization that this is an unsolvable problem, and yet here
 I am faced with it and intellectually gape in wonder of it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's this Doctor Who episode, and I don't like Doctor Who, as it mostly
 is intellectually boring and stupid and childlike, written for children,
 but I've watched enough of it and it does sometimes leave n impression,
 and the story that just popped into my mind just now is the story where
 he is trapped in a time loop, and he figures it out, and he has a diamond
 wall six feet thick to punch through, but every time through the loop,
 he punches the wall, removing some atomically thin part of it, until six
 billion years he's gotten out.
 And this is perhaps the metaphor of my life: a silly, childish metaphor,
 but my trivial, insignificant punch into the intellectual cosmos, noosphere,
 maybe it advances something, maybe it goes somewhere.
 And I haven't even breathed a word about quantum or the universe or anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I did write in this diary, maybe earlier, some of my thoughts about
 quantum.
 But not all of them, I'm sure.
 Some decades ago, I had two notable thoughts in the shower: literally,
 while showering, that felt like revelations from above.
 The first revelation was that I guess revelations are real, and the explanation
 was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum entanglement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the realization that I was quantum entangled with the furthest reaches
 of the universe, I am part of the universe, I am in it, I am one, all is
 one, omni padmi hum.
 Did I diary my thoughts about revelations, yet? Clearly, some revelations
 are patently false.
 I guess.
 It was revealed to me that this and such a rock band (OK, so it was Genesis,
 Peter Gabriel and Tony Banks and all) were the greatest rock band in the
 entire universe.
 Ever.
 For all time.
 Well, what a crock of shit that is: this was not just a revelation, but
 a revelation from God himself, as it were, and that provides all the proof
 one needs that God is full of shit.
 Or, well, hey, never know, maybe they are the greatest rock band in the
 entire universe.
 I suppose there's some certain set of criteria for which this could be
 a true statement.
 But this diverges us off into a debate of what a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true statement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is anyways, and thence I wander off into the Chaitin ideas about oracles
 and knowability.
 And so I have to modify my mental model of what the universe is to accommodate
 for that.
 So the already impossible task got harder.
 Whatever few atoms I've chipped off that diamond barrier, it seems that
 another obstacle has appeared.
 Is that it? Life is locked in a prison, desperately searching how to get
 out, how to go farther, to go where no man has gone before? I have written

intelligence

 to it; that rather instead, intelligence should be sheen as a phase transition
 in network connectivity: in one phase, there is no intelligence, in another,
 there is.
 I won't try to explain what a phase transition is, here, go look it up.
 Read Wikipedia.
 I've been doing this, reading Wikipedia, about thermo and state mech.
 This is the new things, I keep ignoring.
 I spent a lot of time on ergodicity, thinking that it would shed light
 onto thermodynamics, and I guess in a way it did, but ergodicity says nothing
 about phase transitions, and I guess I realize this too late.
 Too late, too late, I will never understand it all, and so back again to
 that painful dilemma: what next, what should I spend my limited remaining
 time on? Conquer the world? Be respected by all? Have more sex? Immerse
 myself in that den of iniquity called social media, for the instant gratificati
on that it delivers? See, here's the thing, no one is reading this diary.
 But if I post on social media, then I will have at least one, maybe two
 readers who will probably not understand what the fuck I'm talking about
 anyway, because who wants to spend that much time anyway, to get into someone
 elses heads?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus a slippery slope for punditry and writing: the desire, the urge to
 be famous.
 All those social media influencers: we've seen it: a certain corruption
 of morals and principles to accommodate the need to be famous, or at least
 earn a stable income from doing so.
 Take Sabine Hofstadter, for example: her earliest work was rare, and provided
 reasonably good insights into QFT, some actually interesting statements
 if you, like me, have a PhD in the topic.
 But lets face it, who has a PhD in theoretical particle physics? And so
 Sabines target audience was much too small.
 and the turns and phases and degrees, she's expanded her audience, at the
 cost off talking about simpler, more basic things, and even more being
 entertaining.
 Like that outfit she wore for the recent portal video: she's hot.
 And so the need to be famous, or perhaps the need to generate a stable
 income, demands an increase in viewership.
 this exerts a certain, what shall I call it, a thermodynamics gradient
 on the social media content, pushing it to a certain type of pablum that
 can resonate in simpler minds, less adept at thinking.
 Why are they less adept? Well, many many reasons, from socio-cultural ones,
 all the standard psychological dimensions, but also the neuropsych wiring
 of the brain, the genetic aspects, the microbio of whatever neurotransmitters
 and re-uptake channel densities in dendral connections there are.
 All that.
 We're mammals, we're not escaping stupidity overnight.
 The larger thermodynamic forces pushing smart people to create entertaining
 content...
 well, this seems like a passing of a moral judgment? Did Sabine prostitute
 herself for the masses? And is that a good thing, or a bad thing? Clearly,
 I guess a bad thing from some 19th century Western academic standpoint,
 where staying true to the academic line was important, but wait, that was
 also a thermo-economic force.
 In the 19th century, life was hard enough that you did have to work 6 days
 a week, 12 hours a day, just to stay warm and fed, and the lucky few who
 landed in academia were cognizant of that fact, of the fact that life was
 hard for most, and so an academic career was treasured and valued and protected
, they way you'd treasure and protect anything ...
 valuable.
 (What is value? What is valuable, we scream? We'll get back to that) The
 20th century has seen a vast overproduction of PhD's, outnumbering academic
 posts four to one.
 And so a different set of thermo-economic forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets see, where were we? Two or three distinct questions: First, are the
 thermo-economic gradients forcing smart people to create stupid social
 media content, is that good, or is that bad? What is the nature of moral
 value judgments like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bad
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 anyway? There's certainly a lot of reactionary talk of preserving old (19th
 century) mores and values, as these are the things that made Western society
 great, and these certainly are valid points, or semi-valid: there were
 great good things in the past, and they can provide a value judgment.
 I can't help but get in a snide remark: just look at the Palestinians:
 what a broken, destructive, awful, horrible social force they are; you
 might call it evil, even.
 Destructive of all things we hold dear.
 And social media forces and Pallywood videos have deluded millions to take
 the side of ..
 evil.
 So, yes there are thermo-economic gradients that are inherently evil.
 The one that produced WWI, I've talked about this, may many have talked
 about this: it is one of the simpler(?) inhuman thermo-socio-econo-political
 forces that caused mass destruction and death, and we humans were unable
 to stop this force of death.
 We actively went to the front, with machine guns and mustard gas, to kill.
 Just like college students nowadays go to protests to support Palestinian
 killers, somehow blind to the greater tragedy of the terrible socio-cultural
 malaise, illness, that grips the Palestinian society.
 (This is more clear cut, for me, than talking about russia and russians,
 but perhaps that's because I understand russia and russians better? Hmm).
 So defacto I have passed judgment here, and declared good and evil, but
 on what basis? Well, first, you have to realize, and I have to internalize,
 that there is little or nothing that I can say here that has not been said
 in books on moral philosophy.
 But one: many of those books on moral philosophy are just plain wrong.
 So that's also the strange thing: there is almost nothing that I can say
 that is truly new, and hasn't been thought of before.
 except that there is something, because some of that old stuff doesn't
 entirely hang together, doesn't

 Off-topic: I recall watching on youtube a Ramones interview on some talk-show
 program, and these guys were savvy.
 They were thinking about what it takes to be successful, they were modulating
 their actions and outlook and plans to directly achieve fame and popularity.
 And of course that is how it must be, but I found it curious, because the
 image they project was that of, well, of punk rockers just doing stuff
 for the fuck of it, rather than being driven by some gradient.
 They did things (in their alt persona, as actors on the musical stage)
 the things they did were meant to be perceived as spontaneous nonsense,
 gabba gabba hey, and not as premeditated behavior patterns designed to
 achieve success.
 So the persona is almost like happy-go-lucky homeless people: ripped jeans,
 unkempt hair, and some musical instruments.
 But we don't look at homeless people and say

Good and bad, where was I? Is influencing the future always good? Well clearly
 not: some basic ethical percepts, like prohibitions of murder, and so on,
 these stand.
 Then we had the good-culture vs.
 bad culture questions, and passed the value judgment that Western culture
 was, on the whole, good, and many of the others were bad.
 Bad, sometimes explicitly (e.g.
 in russia, a husband can beat a wife, legally, and this is bad) and bad,
 sometimes implicitly: the economic turgidity of non-European cultures.
 And so that's the next moral judgment: that economic development is good.
 Hmm.
 It is tempting to take this for granted, so perhaps should be picked apart.
 But what can I say here that isn't shallow hand-waving? The influence is
 of sci-fi, Jupiter brains and evolution and all that: somehow, that the
 more complex things are greater, so anything that enables complexification
 is good, by definition, and that which blocks it is bad, in general.
 Hmm.
 That seems pretty morally unambiguous (and those of you who do not understand
 what I'm talking about here, well, fuck you, you're a moron.
 Figure it out, I'm not talking about anything complex here.) Where was I?
 So, complexity is good, non-complexity is bad.

I do wonder about the quantum aspects to this.
 As I said, one of the two shower revelations was that all is connected
 via quantum, which makes me susceptible to woo, and one of the bits of
 woo would be that in writing this, I am channeling ghosts, albeit quantum
 ghosts, from some distant corner of the universe, or perhaps it is the
 multiverse, and so none of this is new and creative, except its all new
 and creative, it is the digital ectoplasm of ghosts talking through me,
 through my keyboard, from alternate parallel universes, So this is my amateur
 contribution to the research of qualia.
 I'm prone to woo, and I like it.
 But so are many, many.
 From where I can tell, most smart people are prone to woo, and most of
 the rest suppress it.
 And I suppose there are some who are woo-less.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

what's up with that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and he gave a nice explanation: its like love: its something you feel,
 and you know it, and there is no question of it, and there is nothing to
 rationalize, because, as qualia, it is there, immediate and direct.
 And, so for the record, I mostly almost never have qualia concerning the
 immediate direct presence of God, save for a few rare occasions in the
 shower where God told me he was everywhere, everything the entire universe,
 its all quantum and I'm entangled with it all, and who am I to say no to
 such a totalizing world-view? And then the usual bullshit about the greatest
 rock band of all time.
 So apparently my immediate, present, here and now God aka qualia can be
 a liar, and no surprise, as clinical evidence of schizophrenic hallucinations
 already explain that this is nothing unusual.
 So we're in this weird superposition: our mammalian brains are prone to
 schizophrenia, but the mild versions there of are God talking to you, and
 people go to church for that, because God talks how love talks you just
 know it.
 The even milder form of this is believing in woo: flying saucers is one.
 I read two essays from the Skeptoid, recently.
 One was claiming that forensic science is in fact forensic pseudo-science,

 The other was the about the recording of human screams coming from hell

 Not all future possibilities can or should be verbalized: we distinguish

 This text is what has been already figured our by me, either just right

 A large part of Buddhism seems to be all about how to shake off and detach
 from the suffering of existence, without actually offing yourself.
 Although, sometimes I think that perhaps Buddhism is not particularly better
 than alcoholism for curing suffering.
 Perhaps one is more functional during the daytime, not being hungover,
 but I get the sense that Buddhists have also renounced will, motivation,
 desire right along with suffering.
 No doubt this last sentence would lead to a huge argument.
 The plan right now is to do some more amateur analysis of this general
 area, although it is now late at night, I'm slowing, and should not get
 myself riled up before going to bed, but not sure what else to do.
 Well, I could pick up a book and read it.
 Distract myself.
 Distraction is an excellent, age-old prescription for suffering.

\begin_layout Standard
And thus I arrive at one of the roots to the problem: leading a long distracted
 life results in time passing by quickly, and lifting up one's head to look
 around: OMG, I've gotten old.
 In my case, 65, which is the prescribe age for retirement in present-day
 US socio-economic culture.
 Fuck.
 And so one looks back: what have I accomplished in life, and as I look
 back at my own, I am not happy.
 Why? Perhaps a disposition, (nah, its not that.) Perhaps I am applying some
 social metric and find my own achievements lacking, as usually measured
 by the convectional Western standards of wealth, fame, power.
 Perhaps these three metrics, deeply embedded into our culture, perhaps
 these cause many in the West to be unhappy: perhaps Western culture really
 is toxic, in this sense.
 There is no

 I could talk about me, and my own perceived failings regarding wealth,
 fame and power.
 I could repeat conventional observations that being rich and powerful does
 not make one happy.
 Although a certain level of money, enough to guarantee comfort, does make
 one happier.
 But I'm above that threshold, so that doesn't apply.
 I could also try to make a social critique of Western culture, but Lord
 knows there are hundreds if not hundreds of thousands of pundits busy pontifica

 This underpins much of culture war.
 I could try to wander down the avenues of Freud and Jung.
 Read Freud 50 years ago, and forgot it all.
 Only skimmed Jung, never read.
 The two are obviously working with ungrounded woo, but so am I: a desire

In this last, writing helps.
 Otherwise, I stand by the toilet, peeing, and thinking idly of my youth

 Of course it doesn't.
 The parents show up, the rest of the tribe, and the conclusion is obvious:
 the robot-monkey has died.
 They conduct an impromptu wake, a solemn funerary affair.
 Apparently, monkeys are quite good at doing solemnity, and know exactly
 when and how.
 So that sense of tragedy is not uniquely human.
 And I strongly suspect that there's good video-graphic evidence that all
 of these

 human traits: sadness, loss, anxiety, sacredness, and their polar opposites:
 profanity and hatred, more or less the entire spectrum, extends down into
 mammals, and possibly vertebrates.
 Which then leads to the question: what's up with that? The reductionist
 view is that it's all neurocircuitry.
 What would it be about neurocircuitry that allows monkeys to feel the loss
 of death, or more generally, maybe even small animals to feel loss, and
 perhaps even psychological pain? We know they feel psychological pleasure:
 lots and lots of videos of just about any animal playing and having fun.
 Documenting heartache is much harder.
 We've documented despondent horses.
 – I saw a YouTube video, where a wild horse was reunited with his wife,
 after years of separation, and you could see the joy of the reunion.
 The video also captured some of the feeling of despondent loss and heartache
 that preceded the reunion.
 So horses go there.

 But instead I want to read bout topological field theory.
 But it seems too late in the night to start that? Or is it? Or will I look

So there's two ways to take this: one is to claim that the sensation of
 sacredness is on the neutral manifold of evolutionary selection.
 The other way is to say its quantum woo, woven into the fabric of spacetime.

emotions in general

 do have some obvious evolutionarily selective benefits: the classic fight
 vs flight, which translates to fear vs aggression, and that translates
 to being careful in decision-making vs being reckless, or perhaps proud,
 or perhaps strong-willed.
 Can it be that all of these more noble emotional-psychological states and
 perceptions are just a ferromagnetic one-off from obvious bio-molecular
 mechanisms that promote survival? Well, now that I think of it, it does
 seem like it could be a sufficient theory, err, hypothesis.
 That our feelings of nobility and sacredness are just a mere hop skip and
 a jump away from more basic instincts, and are explainable with synaptic
 neurotransmitter re-uptake rates? Is that all that there is? Because it
 sure is tempting to assume that sacredness is actually woo: either thanks
 to some Christian, Catholic God, or, who knows Magenta People and Space
 Aliens and Crystals.
 I'm happy to say it is just crossover from other quantum multiverses.
 although this last beggars the question: it just displaces the center of

 Hmmm.
 Perhaps I should read about topological field theories instead of bitching
 about how miserable because I'm old, and not as beautiful as I was, when
 I was young.
 That the life ahead of me is necessarily shorter than that behind me.
 Fuck.
 I don't wanna die, but I guess most everyone doesn't.
 And, as I started this essay: I guess most people feel this anxiety, except
 for fools and the enlightened.
 And yes, perhaps Western culture has not yet performed the qualia research
 needed to find a balance between Weber's Protestants and a path that manages
 psychological suffering.
 Weird-ass shit.
 By reading TFT, I focus on what I'm good at, and leave the psycho mumbo-jumbo
 to the psycho-evolutionary-biochemists.
 Or to the spiritual leaders, when the psychobabble runs out.
 Oh, and of course: we must not ignore the supra-individual forces: not
 just Western thought patterns that promote psychological distress, but
 even Putin's KGB propaganda that explicitly creates psychological alienation
 and deep socio-cultural harm among the russians (and I guess some Serbs,
 and some assorted other psychos out there.) We've got the full stack here:
 from socio-political-cultural forces, sometimes weakly controlled, e.g.
 by Merkel, sometimes strongly and toxically controlled, e.g.
 by the KGB & Siloviki, and sometimes mostly unrestrained and uncontrolled,
 as Western market dynamics which is currently rewarding narcissistic social
 media influencers, and prior to that, a blind worship of power, money,
 fame.
 These supra-personal forces act on our individual sensations of loss, alienatio
n, unmoored non-membership in an atomized society.
 And these rather abstract sensations are somehow just one-off from the
 evolutionary pressures that guided survival and shaped DNA.
 And so I sit here, and wonder: is it wiser for me to stew in this soup
 of self-pity and vague wonder, or is it better to get busy, get active,
 and fucking read the topological field theory text? Well, I'm all typed

 have is a neurotic train-wreck of thoughts regarding the meaning of life.
 Each and every commonplace and quotidian observation about human psychology,
 made over the millennia, arrives to me like a new shock, an unheard-of
 and unbelievable state of affairs, how did this crisis develop? It was
 always a crisis, there's an annoying but fun pop song from the 1980's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, so it's not like I'm foreign to these ideas but they still come as a shock.
 Each and every human quirk and foible, every dumb thing I ever did to waste
 time, comes as a new surprise to me: The things that I did, why did I do
 them? What was the point? Pleasurable at the time, even enjoyable, am I
 really the slave to dopamine 24/7, and have no free will? I'm just carried
 hither and tither by the shifting currents?

and frankly, its a mixture of the angst I have felt, that everyone must
 surely feel from time to time, some more deeply, others more shallowly,
 and finally, somewhere in there, just plain neurotic thoughts that are
 best suppressed and avoided.
 Yet portions of that psychoanalytic crisis, I empathize with: some gnawing
 anxiety as I fell asleep, but also a glimmer of higher truths, a promise
 of revelation just around the corner; as it will all come together, the
 meaning of it all just around the corner.
 Even as I know rationally, this can never be; the human mind is too limited,
 too constrained; a lifetime is too short to figure it all out; it would
 never fit on this page anyway.
 But like any poet or playwright, one tries to grab at the fleeting evidence,
 the tincture, the essence of the matter, even as it poetically escapes
 one's grasp like water through the finger, leaving only the fleeting wetness,
 the memory of something almost attained, but in the end unknowable.

That full spectrum of *everything* that humans do, and act out, and think
 about, let it all be represented by (*).
 open-paren asterisk close paren.
 Everything, all, one, the whole kielbasa.
 So let me mark out (*) on this page.
 there it's been set here.
 Now this, this thing, this all-ness, what is it's relation to AGI? Where
 does it stand? What's the interplay? This is the ocean I am boiling, what
 what what ...
 did I mention I am jet-lagged and am not particularly focused? I guess
 I sat down here to write exactly this: the meaning of life is to be unfocused,
 undirected, mostly unaware, mostly unperceiving; sometimes bewilderered.
 It is drizzling outside; I should go for a walk, I should drink some coffee
 I should get some sleep.
 I'm tangled in the web that has ensnared many millions if not many billions
 of poets over the centuries, and there is kind of literally almost nothing
 I can add to the conversation that has not been said before.
 Except that, as a million monkeys, typing at a million typewriters, here
 is my novel contribution of logorrhea.
 Yet another random arrangement of words on a page, full of sound and fury,
 signifying nothing.
 WTF, really, WTF.
 The alternative is to stay silent, but that's hardly any more fun.
 Depends on the time of day, on the mood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this is, of course, the basic psychological question for AGI: faced
 with superhuman intelligence, what will it do, what will it think about?
 If I have the passing urge to play solitaire, read a book, go pee, or socialize
, I can go indulge that urge, and all will be well.
 Usually, most of the time.
 Unless, of course, I've had my feelings hurt, am in a foul mood, have a
 headache or am jet-lagged.
 What is the psychological landscape for a super-intelligent AGI? What would
 it entail? Is there's a snowballs chance in hell that it would be neurotic,
 like Marvin the robot from Hitchhiker's guide? How does all this human
 psychological frailty work out in a super-intelligence?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so let me take this seriously, and psychoanalyze.
 I've been using the example of a corporation as an example of a weak super-AGI.
 Do corporations have an inner psychological life? How about WWI? How about
 the political zeitgeist? Well, corporations seem to be psychologically
 empty: empty shells: active, alive, doing something, but little evidence
 of any internal life.
 Corporations crank out products and services, and that's all.
 Is there more? Well, I dunno.
 Say, a hospital chain: the overt reason for being is to cure humans.
 Certainly, the nurses strive to be compassionate, and sometimes even the
 doctors too.
 The corporate motto may even reflect this.
 But this is not evidence of an inner life.
 A hospital chain may as well be a jellyfish, for all of the psychological
 content one can decode from observing it's behavior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How about WWI? It seems to have been a soulless, evil machine that killed
 young men, until the raw material: young men, ran out.
 Did WWI have an inner life? No particular evidence for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how would one know? I can read a play, and the text itself is brimming
 over with neurotic self-flagellation.
 I can read someone else's diary, and see boundless signs of an inner life.
 Almost all TV entertainment is almost exclusively focused on the inner
 psychological life of humans: people are what interest us.
 There's no mistaking this.
 But what would happen if I did a textual analysis of all things WWI? What
 can be gleaned from some algorithmic analysis, that is not already commonly
 known? Is there any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, there? Perhaps corporations and WWI are just to alien, as intelligences,
 to be able to perceive any psychological dimension within them.
 Putting it under a microscope, at best we see some glimmers of the CEO,
 the work of the communications dept.
 and maybe the work of engineers: as people, in the flesh, having wittingly
 or unwittingly expressed itself and willed that expression over into the
 fabric of the corporate being-essence.
 I dunno.
 Seems pretty thin.
 I can't even point at a specific thing that could be examined, measured,
 calibrated using some scientific techniques for pigeonholing psychological
 being-ness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only supra-individual being-ness that I can think of that might have
 its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 internal neurotic life, is some socio-cultural political expression.
 Say, ultra-nationalism, or something like that.
 Ugh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now we come to the crux of the matter.
 Will super-intelligent AGI be devoid of a psychological internal life?
 That seems truly bizarre.
 The sensation of qualia is central to human, mammalian existence, it seems
 impossible to ascribe the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intelligence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to something devoid of concepts like anguish and hope.
 Somehow a true AGI must 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in some way, as otherwise, it seems absurd to assigning it the vaunted
 status of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a living thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Yet, it's equally absurd to imagine AGI as some angst-filled teenager.
 We know joy and suffering, so surely a super-intelligence must likewise.
 But oh, the heights and depths of human manic depression are fearsome as
 they are: to have an even deeper and broader purview? How would that even
 be? The x-risk of a psychotic AGI is well-recognized.
 The x-risk of despondent, neurotic AGI, not so much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 I suppose others have thought about this, too, and have even written more
 eloquently and deeply than I.
 So my task to to read, and see what is known? As if I don't have enough

This feeling jet-lagged is a bit like feeling hungover.
 I understand that there are people with debilitating chronic diseases,
 where they feel like shit, feel like this, all the time.
 Wow.
 I must pity them.
 This is almost unendurable.
 Every last bodily sensation is screaming: go to sleep! Go to sleep! Go
 to sleep! And yet I know that the only way to avoid future hell, tomorrow,
 is to prolong the present hell, today.
 This is fucked up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there's sleep.
 We've got good evidence that more or less everything with nerve cells in
 it sleeps.
 What is sleep? It seems absurd that an AGI would ever need to sleep; why
 would it? But given that we have not a clue as to why we need to sleep,
 well, then, would it not be an error to dismiss it's importance? Of course
 it would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, enough of this.
 I need to get back to reading things.
 One last thought: I've been working on the mathematics of structure, and
 have gotten my first mathematical glimpses of agency.
 I guess that the mathematics of psychology must be embedded inside that
 of agency.
 I guess we'll need to BOLO, be on the lookout for psychology when working
 with the mathematical framework for agency.
 That could be ...
 interesting to find.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Footnote: as I've complained: I've been feeling anxiety, and n moments of
 almost lucidity, I feel like I might almost be able to place it in a universal
 setting, appropriate for extrapolation into a non-human domain.
 Almost.
 Maybe it can't be done, but as I tossed and turned during a nap this afternoon,
 I felt as if I almost grasped this.
 So expect more writing on this topic, to come.
 (Also expect more self-analysis, and perhaps some cameos of mental states
 of mind, focusing on others, or perhaps my wonderment and interpretation
 of what I see in others.)

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt weighs in on where AI is headed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Published May 21, 2024 at https://www.noemamag.com/mapping-ais-rapid-advance/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curious juxtaposition.
 Most curious is how Schmidt doesn't breath the single slightest word about
 the role of AI in social media and disinformation.
 Is he really that ignorant and naive, or is he disingenuously covering
 up the crimes of the large corporations? Perhaps both? I suspect both:
 he simply does not understand the psycho-social mess that has been created.
 Heh.
 Vytautas Kavolis was writing about psychohistory in the 1980's, and he
 was hardly the deepest or most influential author: he himself gives credit
 to Erich Fromm for laying the groundwork for cultural psychology: and Erich
 Fromm was writing in the 1930's through 1950's.
 These are not new ideas, but why would they concern corporate CEO's? So
 of course Eric Schmidt is ignorant of such topics.
 But disingenuous, as well; he full-well knows of Congressional investigations
 into corporate malfeasance with respect to disinformation and propaganda
 on social media.
 So why does he not connect these dots when he talks about AI? Naivete?
 Stupidity? Pangs of guilt? There's an elephant in the room, but lets pretend
 it is invisible.
 WTF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He does neatly summarize three interesting recent developments that I'm
 going tow write down, so that perhaps I will remember them and have them

 I quote from the article:

\emph on
There are roughly three things going on now that are going to profoundly
 change the world very quickly.
 ...
 (a) an infinite context window, (b) chain of thought reasoning in agents
 and then (c) the text-to-action capacity for programming.
 ...
 So your agent, my agent, her agent and his agent will all combine to solve
 a new problem.
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, if I have this right: (a) a context window such that the LLM does not
 loose track of what it is talking about, (b) self-evident, (c) ability
 to write code/programming.
 So (a) is very interesting, (b) very important, (c) I don't think this
 will be achieved, except maybe at some very modular, directed level.
 Eric seems not to have understood that the hard thing about software is
 not creating it, but debugging it.
 If there was some DL/NN that was capable of debugging ...
 now that would indeed be revolutionary.
 From what I can tall (as an outsider who is not glued to the latest news)
 this is still very much in the future.
 The compositionality of agents does indeed seem to be an interesting situation
 that will open new vistas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 As I read the Schmidt interview, it seemed pretty exciting, but as I sit
 here now to tap out these words, the excitement has faded into normalcy.
 Yes, generative AI is advancing very quickly.
 Yes, in many ways it is revolutionary.
 Yes, I was briefly excited by an imagined combination of (a) (b) (c) and
 yet my excitement fades, since ...
 well, its not entirely resonating.
 I don't quite yet see how generative AI will be capable of physics and
 math, even as it will very obviously be superb at predicting weather and
 protein folding.
 But protein folding is very different than foundational mathematical research,
 and I don't see how that chasm will soon be crossed.
 So my excitement has faded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely, basic science requires (b) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

chain of thought reasoning

, but the chain of thought reasoning that has been exhibited so far has
 been very flawed verbal reasoning.
 That is, the chaining together of words into sentences, rather than the
 abstraction of the ideas and concepts behind those words.
 But there are hundreds if not thousands of brilliant researchers attacking
 this problem, so perhaps there is some progress I don't know of.
 Certainly possible.

17 June 2024 Part Two: Self-awarenes via perception-action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a related note: t recently shot into my head that I can use the sensory
 perception-action framework that I've tinkered with to also observe the
 self: to observe one's own thoughts.
 For the system to observe itself, to control its own actions.
 This is can even be recursive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got this idea while drifting off to sleep.
 The jet-lag associated with arriving in Vilnius lead to a mid-day nap,
 tanked up on coffee.
 I've since done a few more of these, and even before leaving Austin: 3
 or 4 or 5 cups of coffee, wired, more or less, but somehow exhausted from
 some sort of early morning strenuous thinking, and desiring a nap.
 This has been happening more frequently; it was never something I've dealt
 with years-earlier.
 Now, it seems, after a few hours of hard thinking, I need to take a nap,
 no matter how much coffee I've had.
 (Although programming tasks allow me to stay engaged and power through.
 So programming is unaffected.
 Writing, however, is.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, as I fall asleep, I find that I'm free-associating very widely,
 almost randomly, with disparate, unrelated ideas flitting through my head.
 And I can observe this chain of disassociation, as I am not yet fully asleep.
 And so I was thinking how this is kind of like what not-so-large LLM's
 do: they free-associate through grammatical syntactically correct chains
 of words that are not entirely anchored in specific thoughts.
 That is, LLM's are dreaming.
 We can prompt them into having directed dreams, and take the results as
 answers to our questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I got to thinking: can we use the same perception-action architecture
 to perceive the LLM, and so prompt it into a form of awareness, that perhaps
 I could call self-awareness? I think so.
 And I think this is perhaps a key break-through in my thinking.
 But, of course, the devil is in the details, and I haven't gone through
 the details, yet.
 Worse, I am sleepy.
 It would be kind of cool if I could somehow record the thoughts the fleet
 through my head, as I fall asleep.
 I could, I suppose, fitfully wake to jot them down.
 But that would be hard.

\begin_layout Standard
One thing I am noticing: I can have a fully-formed thought in seconds: literally
, just two to five seconds, and then it will take me five or ten minutes
 to write it down in this diary, or even half an hour or more.
 It's a gear-shift in slow-down, between getting the idea, and writing it
 down (articulating it).
 Now, in a certain sense, I didn't get the idea in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

two to five seconds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: I might have been working on it for days or years.
 But for those days or years, there is nothing, no comprehension, no advance,
 nothing important to write about or comment, and if writing were to be
 attempted, all that would come of it would be the anxiety of not knowing
 the answer.
 So after weeks or decades of general pondering, the answer finally appears
 in seconds.
 But the contextual back-story to the answer is ...
 weeks or decades long, so of course, as I write down the idea, it takes
 ...
 hours to write an adequate context (for this here diary, where, in a sense,
 I am writing for myself, and not for the general public, so I can already
 assume a certain familiarity with what's going on in my own mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Err, well, that sounds weird.
 Of course I 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 what is going on in my mind.
 And of course one possible life-choice is to sit and stare t a blank wall,
 and contemplate.
 The choice here of writing down the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things I already know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is ...
 well, its interesting.
 I'm doing this for a reason, I explained this reason much earlier in this
 diary, I believe.
 If I haven't, well, then I'm sure I will explain it again, someday.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the meanwhile, the self-perception of one's own thoughts, and the possibility
 of converting that into actual software via the sensory framework, that
 seems like an important breakthrough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odd thing is, though, as I fall asleep, many or most of the ideas I get
 at just that moment seem important.
 I suppose many of them wilt in the bright sunlight of daytime: cares evaporate.
 And I guess this is one reason why people drink and party at night: the
 drink loosens one's mind, and the evening mindset brings back into beingness
 all of those concerns and ideas that had gone into hiding when exposed
 in the harsh mid-day sun.
 Huh.
 I could write many more paragraphs in this vein, but I think you see where
 I am going with this.

Well, if you are to act as a diary, then I have to write you.
 This takes effort, and the energy for this can be lacking.
 Lets start with the obvious.
 One can say anything, and do anything, and performing requires a choice,
 and some choices are bounded by barriers: one has to summon energy to do
 certain things, and not others.
 Compounding this is a need to prioritize.
 This is a rational need, that is, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I should prioritize
\begin_inset Quotes erd

; and my current personality is that I would prefer to do what I feel like,

 that I must force myself to deal with.
 I am reminded of the Star Wars actor, Harrison Ford who, asked the secret

.
 I'm not exploring new intellectual ground, I am running round in mental
 circles, mouse on a mouse wheel, contemplating in circular loops, visiting

 It appears this gets weaker over time (age): energy requires health.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two more trite remarks about writing: for this to be successful, I have
 to keep writing until I'm exhasusted.
 The choice to write, right now, means that I am avoiding (not doing) other
 things that I should do.
 Then there is the issue of topics to write about: I have many many topics
 I could go on about.
 Why this, and why not that? The number of choices I am faced with, the
 number of topics, is so overwhelming, that the choice of focus is all but
 random.
 So this is a meta-essay about free-will and action-selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some more pre-roll, before I get to the main topic for this afternoon.
 ...
 Hmm.
 But I'm not writing that, because the effort to write it exceeds the expected
 future value of actually writing it.
 I should not spend energy on writing drivel.
 Fuck.
 Or at least, exploring things that are probably, almost certainly drivel,
 but possibly might not be, because they are close to the centers of power.
 Perhaps life is like that: as one approaches the fundamental thing, the
 nearby landscape appears barren.
 This last sentence is cryptic, but only because I'm too lazy to expand
 on the amalgam of mental images I hold in my head, as I write it, because
 those images might not support the weight of the claim.
 They are not strong enough, they are imaginary objects, that seem to go
 toethe, but have not yet been shaped into truth, or found to be rotten
 and insubstantial.
 This is the curse of the inept: mistaking imaginary visions as solid foundation
s, and making unjustified extrapolations from them.
 But we've known this for thousands of years.
 And the wise men are rendered speechless, since they recognize the infirmity
 of their thoughts.
 Leaving the future open for only the bold.
 All this is well-known to psychology and sociology and what not, and I
 intereset with it here only insofar as trying to gain insight into my own
 possible futures: what should I do? I watched the movie Oppenheimer on
 the plane trip home.
 Would he have been a great physicist, if he'd stuck to physics, instea
 of leadership? Would he be remembered or revered? Not as much: the corridors
 of power shape the world, and he shaped the world.
 But this required abandoning scientific pursuits.
 Is there a lesson for me? Well, only that its too late: it takes decades
 to hone a skill; I have not decades in front.
 I can still, however, nuruture my interests in math and science and in
 the broader world of humanity and love and art and living...
\end_layout

 Apparently, I'm in love.

 is a reasonable surrogate for the emotional stew that I am marinating in.
 I'm rather enjoying it, and hope it does not fade soon, even though there's
 a certain amount of heartache in it.
 I like it.
 I suppose some facts are in order.
 It's impossible, impractical, marginally unrequieted or maybe not.
 Can't tell, and perhaps the not knowing is part of the magic.
 The feeling is as much of my own creation, as it is that of the world outside.
 As if we are isolated systems, locked in our skulls, with thick thick insulatio
n between our own inner lives, and those of others.
 In math terms, the distance between my inner life, and that of any other
 living being is given by a hypermetric: there is no shorter route, between
 me and you, than the conversion of emotions and drives and desires and
 wants into words and actions.
 There is no Vulcan mind-meld that allows my personal somatic experience
 to join with yours.
 The expression of my feelings and emotions must take an indirect path.
 In the present case, with words.
 And as always, I'm not even sure that a human will ever read these words
 ...
 and as before I re-iterate, I am not wriging for humans, which is perhaps
 why I'm a bit sloppy here.
 I stop short of being raving incoherent, since, well, perhaps someone will
 read this, and I don't want them to think I am a madman (as I am not.
 I may operate a bit outside the boundary of social norms, but that is because
 I don't care, and not because I'm crazy.
 Although one could argue that ignoring social norms is crazy.
 But this wanders down a diletantish track.
 I am noting that Americans are perhaps disinhibited a bit more than Lithuanians

\begin_layout Standard
So here's the backstory.
 I've been going to Vilnius annually, for about a decade, for unexplored,
 unvoiced, inarticulate reasons.
 I've not been able to reflect on the reasons why.
 This might be because if I did, I would not go: there is no particular
 rational reason why I should go.
 It does not advance my career, it detracts from my mathematical studies,
 it hinders economic gain.
 By all rights, I should wash my hands of it, and remain solidly American,
 and live a forgetten, meaningless American life that only other Americans
 can understand, but do not value.
 Out of a year, I'd have an extra month.
 Whoop de do.
 So there's been this vague rationalization that I should explore my roots,
 my cultural heritage.
 There are actually very strong reasons to do this, and as I've never quite
 set them to writing, nows the chance.
 I grew up in a de facto embassy.
 My parents social activities involved the building of bridges into the
 Lithuanian cultural elite, and working on ways to have them be invited
 to the US: prying open the door of the Soviet jail, and obtaining visas
 for the Lithuanian intelligensia to come to the US.
 This included actors, writers, singers, poets, ballerinas, any and all
 of the cultural elite.
 Historical records record their names, and they all stayed at my parents
 house, in my formative years of 10 to 15 years old.
 So I bathed in this, like a sponge.
 I understood the Soviet world like no American would, but I also took for
 granted the ideas of high culture.
 My grandma spoke Polish; I regret only that she did not teach me.
 She subscribed to the Parisian journal Kultura, (written in Polish, and
 annoyingly having no photos, pictures or diagrams in it.
 A disaster for the young.) And all the talk of Generolas Plechavičius.
 Pre-war hero.
 This: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Povilas_Plechavi%C4%8Dius Died when I
 was 13.
 Well, that explains a lot.

 The formal events (Daunoras at the opera, and so on).
 These were the formative years, and I was steeped in Lithuanism.
 So the net result of this is that 40-50 years later, I'm in search of some
 mythical roots.
 The intervening years were ..
 .zero.
 I was busy doing something else, and there was nothing that Lithuanian-ness
 seemed to offer.
 Steeped in it, I didn't see the point, because it did not ....
 something that it didn't do.
 What? I don't know.
 I didn't think about it.
 I kind of did not see the point of socializing.
 Sometimes lonely, but socializing was not big on my list of activities,
 and the social events I participated in were the ones I was sucked into,
 and not the ones I seeked out.
 Socializing anf friends and friendship seemed hollow and empty.
 I mean, I occasionally agonized from the loneliness.
 And yes, it was painful.
 Yet, oddly, finding social events to attend did not arise as a solution,
 mostly because social events were all so meaningless and hollow and empty.
 So, a reinforcing non-virtuous cycle.
 I did not make freinds, because there wasn't anyone worth making friends
 with.
 Everyone was a disappointment from the get-go.
 So eventually I gave up.
 Not an explicit decision, just something one sinks into.
 I don't think this is uncommon.
 I see social media posts about how people like to stay home.
 There's even a song about it.
 Courtney Barnett, if I recall.
 Current generations suffer from this in droves, there is even the debate
 about

So, my meaning crisis was not a crisis, per se, but rather an unexplored,
 unarticulated, vaguely cloudy idea that I should spend some time in Vilnius,
 and, well, see what that is all about.
 Its more about the low-cost opportunity.
 I just have to hop on an airplane, and there I am.
 Easy, no muss, no fuss, no demands, no responsibilities beyond paying the
 bills.
 And so I show up, like a dope, and wander randomly through the streets,
 unclear about what I am doing there, or why I'm there.
 And, for many of those summers, I'm lonely.
 Because I have no friends there, no acquaintances, and not even any real
 mechanisms for making acquaintances, except by randomly inserting myself
 into random groups of drinkers in Užupis, but this is often difficult,
 and not entirely pleasant, until one is integrated.
 It's not that I'm shy, although I used to be.
 I think I've gotten over that.
 Just that, well, its hard to get the instant hit, the instant thrill going,
 where you launch into extrovert-land.
 The dopamine hits are hard in coming.

The reliable background was Milda and Miglė.
 The renters.
 They were there, they were nice, they sometimes asked me out on social
 events.
 I didn't always know how to behave; American standards and Lithuanian standards
 are different.
 I'm a weirdo, especially when I'm dealing with conventional people with
 whome I have fairly little in common with.
 And frankly, I had little in common with these girls, but, thanks to their
 constant presence, I could adjust, and get to know them.
 Miglė and I did go on a semi-formal day-time date, but it went poorly,
 because we could not really find anything to talk about.
 It chugged along politely, but never caught fire.
 But she lived there, and I would see her almost daily, and we were (and
 are) friends.
 Went to visit her in Nida, this summer.
 She's married to a restauraeur; she's the director of a hotel & restaurant.
 Nida's got beautiful beaches.
 Water warms up in July.
 In those earlier summers, the girls would sometimes double-date me, and
 this was fun, because I had the attention of two people.
 Sometimes they'd throw parties, and this was always fun when it was at
 Pilies g.
 where I live, because one could walk around and mix.
 Parties at outdoor bars were harder, because one could not mix: one would
 lock in with whoever you sat next to, and if things didn't light up, I
 was stuck, and I didn't figure out that, duhh, I could just stand up and
 walk around.
 All this is not hard, but ...
 well, I'm not well-practiced at socializing, but I've been learning.
 Old age comes fast, faster than wisdom.

Miglė moved out a few years ago; she found a husband, and left.
 This left Milda.
 I liked being at home with her.
 She would ..
 be around.
 We'd talk.
 She'd cook me meals.
 Good meals; she knows all the basics of cooking.
 She's also a bit of a hippie-chick in a kind onf classic (well, modernized
 for techno-raves) hippie-chick, and that made everything easy, because
 I knew how that worked, from my high-school years.
 And sometimes, as time went by, we'd talk about more intimate things.
 Including the meaning of life.
 And a whole range of things.
 And this was pleasant.
 So much so that, when she'd leave on a long weekend to go somewhere, I'd
 be left alone, and lonely.
 I'd have to make do for myself.
 I actually sort of resented that.
 It's like, she's avoiding me, I would tthink to myself, and then I'd rationaliz
e: no not at all, she's just leading her life.
 She's a tenant, she is fre to do as she pleases.
 And then I'd sometimes think that I'm not fun to be around, and OK, so
 mostly that's correct: I'm not some ball of party-fun.
 I'm a nerdy intellectual at best, with some amount of charisma skills.
 But I'm old and ugly because getting old makes you ugly.
 WTF.
 Wish I was beautiful again, but that's hard.
 Err, not really doable.
 Supplements and exercise do only so much, and dieting is fucking hard.
 And she's almost 30 years younger or thereabouts.
 Something like that.
 So why would someone that young want to hang out with old wrinkled prune
 like myself? No reason.
 So she'd leave, and I'd feel lonely.

Somewhere along the way, things changed.
 One summer, she was around almost every night.
 Another summer, I met her boyfriend(s) (past, and future).
 Some unsuccessful efforts to go to nightclubs, where like she's the oldest
 person there (not counting me) and this was, well, she saw she didn't quite
 fit any more: not that she was an old maid (which, technically, I guess
 she was.
 Either that, or a liberated woman) but that doesn't work if the 20-somethings
 aren't hanging out with you because you're 30-something, and she felt that,
 and I could see it, how the 20-somethings would look at her, and their
 faces would say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

too old
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and that helped bond us a little bit.
 (I got the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who's that old weirdo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 thing, which gave a slight advantage, because that made me exotic.) Then
 one summer, she went all buddhist.
 Bought a lotus lamp for mediation, and incense, and that gong-thing.
 Bought assorted Hindu welf-help and advice literature, which I assumed
 she read.
 Quit drinking.
 That summer, we talked about spiritual topics.
 And more deeply about intimate and personal topics.
 (And I could do this, as I feel that I'm about as spiritually liberated
 and enlightened and aware, as it gets, without formal training or formal
 titles.
 I can give meaningful and correct spiritual advice.
 In part precisely because I was used to dettachement: of not having freinds,
 not having wants or desires, observing the world as an outsider rather
 than as a participant.
 Decades of being alone, of being married to math and physics and high tech,
 it anchored me in that fabled buddhist realm of not just renouncing all
 desires, but of not having had them, in the first place.
 I didn't have to quit the material world, I was always dettached from it.
 Anyway, those are my spiritual bona-fides in a paragraph blurb.) So, we
 could talk about personal things, and I was really getting to like her
 as a person, as an adult, as a friend, as someone I could talk to in a
 mature way about meaningful things.
 A bond.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

friendship
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the conventional dictionary word for this, but, it seems that I'd never
 entirely understood what it meant to be a friend.
 It turns out to be deeper and more complicated than what the dictionary
 says.
 At any rate, I liked her, and I enjoyed being with her.
 It never entirely reached the level of sexual attraction.
 Perhaps some vague, subsconscious undertone, but not acknowledged in any
 sort of waking state.
 But you know, opposite sex, so attraction is never entirely absent.
 It's always percolating in the background.
 But what ever.
 Last summer, she was a freind, a close friend, at that.
 Someone I valued, someone I liked, someone I enjoyed being with, someone
 I was at ease with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This summer began on a similar note.
 I arrived, she opened the door, she prepared dinner, in a small celebration
 and I passed out from jet lag.
 The next day, she is preparing to leave for ...
 a long time.
 Days? A week? I dunno, I didn't keep track.
 This was normal, its how things were.
 I was sad to not have her company, but I did not voice any regrets, and
 wished her a bon voyage.
 Later, she sent a few charming photos.
 And so things went.
 I was busy preparing for Santara-Šviesa, and had other preoccupations,
 and she'd be around, and sometimes she'd go out, and we're like house-mates,
 which, de facto we are.
 And I thought nothing of it.
 In retrospect, we had maybe slightly less social contact, than earlier
 summers.
 But I barely noticed.
 I was busy, I had things to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then one fateful evening.
 There's always a fateful evening.
 She arranges a going-away dinner, just she and I, even though going-away
 is more than a week in the future.
 We buy a bottle of champagne, and she cooks dinner.
 We eat outside (I'd cleared the yard of weeds the week before.) The weather
 is perfect; it's been perfect all summer.
 Her sister comes by, and brings a bottle of champagne, too.
 I have to do something, I forget what, take the plates upstairs, or something,
 maybe go to the shop next door, and while i'm gone, I think she downs half
 the bottle of champagne.
 She's skinny.
 Not an ounce of fat.
 Not anorexic, but starving.
 I'm pretty sure that any given quantity of alcohol has a far bigger efect
 on her than on me, but I don't realize how drunk she is.
 Because I'm not monitoring, because that's not what freinds do.
 And she's a bit touchy-feely, and that's nice, I enjoy a woman's touch.
 It's warm, and it feels good.
 And dinner is over, and we go with her (twin!) sister, back to where her
 sister's husband's bar is, on Gedimino Prospekto.
 He's trying to run a bar for Belorussians, and Milda is vaguely irritated
 about the situation, says he has a bad attitude, but whatever, I had not
 met him before, even though I've played with his three-year-old child (and
 she's a fire-cracker! All signs point at a healthy, active, strong adult,
 and this is visible at age three.) So I meet the husband, and we sit around
 and drink a bit, not much cause I'm alreay drunk, and taking care, and
 Milda is enjoying things and getting drunker, and leaning into me, and
 leaning into my crotch like she lost her balance and needs to put her hand
 there to stabilize, and that OK, cause it feels good, and it sort of keeps
 getting more and more physical, and she's probably really drunk at this
 point, but there are five of us sitting around, and no one bats an eye,
 until I realize it is time to take her home because it's gone too far,
 and as a joke I scoop her up and try to carry her.
 Which works for about 50 yards but then I have to put her down, and I never
 thought of trying out the firemans carry, but it as no emergency, but we
 do have an extremely wobbly walk home.
 And I feel completed to hold her firmly by the waist so that she doesn't
 fall over, and I pilot us both home, two steps left and one step right
 the entire way, and it gets more intimate with each step, and then, before
 we get home she stops, looks up at me, parts her lips, so of course I kiss
 her.
 And then I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 (And I'm like thinking, I don't want to lose a good freindship.
 And (much much more mundanely) I don't want a tenant who flips out and
 rips up the apartment.
 And actually, I'd even thought this through years ago, realizing that this
 was a possible eventuality, because, well, I guess the magnetism was always
 there, even if not acted upon, because, well, we just didn't know each
 other enough.
 Anyway, I'd thought about this eventuality before.)

And in through the gate, and up the stairs, and we're home.
 And she says, maybe then, or maybe earlier in the evening, that, well,
 she's always loved me, loved me for years, and I accepted that at face
 value, but what do I know, maybe she was drunk and scheming but she's not
 a schemer, but maybe this had been percolating in her brain, and being
 wildly drunk allowed it to come out, but the things one says when one is
 drunk do not reflect your true and balanced self, but are rather, some
 tiny part of you peronsaliy, unchained and let free from the inhibitions
 of the construct of the whole, entire self.
 You say things that are unmuffled, and sometimes, you regret them later.
 If you remember them.
 But who knows.
 That's what she said.
 And I like that.
 And (let's set the scene) we're in the kitchen, fully dressed, and bumping
 and griding, and I'm thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this is the part where we take our clothes off
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but we don't and I'm trying to feel her up, but she pushes my hands away
 from the most intimate place.
 And its all but 4AM and its late, and I realize I'm really tired, and she's
 really drunk, and this is not going to go anywhere, I mean, even if it
 did, it would just be bad sex, and bad sex is kind of no fun, and it wouldn't
 really accomplish anything because that's not how stable human relationships
 can work out.
 So I head upstairs to bed, and she to her bedroom, and we sleep.
 I sleep little and wake up early and expectantly, and she sleeps a full
 8 hours, plus, to where I'm alarmed and go wake her.
 But shes fine and we have brunch, and vaguely talk about the night before,
 but I don't recall, she dances away and deflects.
 And ...
 I don't recall.
 Nothing happens.
 She takes another nap; I have some errand to run.
 The rest of the day, Sunday, passes quietly, and Monday is a workday or
 something and well, life returns to some normal usual pace, except I occasional
ly wink and prod and ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

what was that all about?

 and I don't get an answer, and that's OK, because, well, we're like freinds,

 but we get there.
 And, to summarize: well,

Some details, since I think these details help set up what comes later,
 which is what I really want to talk about, which I haven't gotten to yet.
 Stuff about feelings and emotions and qualia.
 The bus leaves early, 8AM, and I'm like, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

let be the bad kids and take the last row of the bus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and we do, because there's more room.
 And its fun.
 But it's early, and we're both ztill zonked, and its a five-hour ride,
 so we nap.
 And as I nap, I am leaned up against her arm, or rather, she is leaned
 into mine.
 And it is heavenly.
 Words can't describe, but try, they will try.
 I don't want it ever to end.
 Because it is an affirmation of the earlier events.
 The come-on, followed by some distancing.
 This veers back into the affirmation territory.
 And what do I get out of it? Someone loves me.
 Perhaps I am reading something into this that isn't really there.
 Perhaps I'm projecting, or letting my imagination run free.
 But that's OK, I'm down with it.
 Someone loves me, and they are showing it in this very simple and ethereal
 way: they are nestled up to my arm, and resting.
 Resting together, resting comfortably, freely, in physical contact, and
 it is heavenly, because I am loved.
 And to be very very clear, this is something I haven't felt in decades.
 I've been married for three decades, but Patty, my wife, does not know
 how to show love, She doesn't show love.
 And I'm this frail, delicate flower, or maybe a puppy is a better word
 for it.
 I want love, freakin puppy love.
 Erotic sex is OK, but puppy love is even better, and this is what I am
 getting, or what I imagine I am getting, right now.
 I'm slumbering on a bumpy bus, and someone else, a female, a close friend,
 soeone who told me they loved me just a few nights ago, she's nestled up
 to me, slumbering as well.
 It's freakin heavenly, and I do all that I can to keep that feeling alive.
 I don't fall asleep I don't wake up, I don't open my eyes to look.
 I just rest and enjoy, for a very very long time.
 Because it feels so good.
 I am loved.
 Nothing is nicer than this.

And this last paragraph is perhaps why I am writing all of this.
 It's maybe even the climax of the story (not the finale, there's more to
 come) but this is the point I'm hunting for.
 So, lets for a moment take a hike into the cold intellectual land.
 As a AGI researcher, I think about math and logic, and this is very very
 far away from qualia and feelings.
 One recent project barely scratches the surface of this, and maybe not
 even that: the understanding of qualia remains deeply out of bounds.
 And so here I am and perhaps as a first step, a phenomenological collection
 of qualia is a reasonable place to start,.
 a reasonable activity.
 I've already exhausted the brainwashing and delusinoal aspects of the Ukraine
 war, and the reactive control, and the KGB/FSB mind-ops to distort social
 perception and reality.
 I think I've written about this in the pages above; and it not, then I've
 tweeted about it.
 Or talked about it at length.
 Not like I have anything concrete, but I've gotten as far as I can easily
 get in that domain.
 So the qualia of personal lived experience is a good next topic.
 If I have time later, I will write about perfume, as this is another adventure
 story.
 But, for now, it will be love, and it will be puppy love.
 (Later on, I actually tried to have erotic dreams about Milda, but failed.
 Apparently, my attraction really is that of freindship morphed into child-like
 love.
 Attempting to get erotic with that kind of spoils everything, so I didn't
 try too hard.
 Will have to wait for the real thing.
 Some other day.
 I very much would like to get there, but clearly, this is not practical,
 for now.

eros

 is the root of erotic, and that's not where this is at.
 Yes, this all may have started with passion, infatuation and attraction.
 But the element of lust remains frustrated and buried and repressed (and
 even unwillingly so, manifesting carnal knowledge would be just fine by
 me.
 But again, that will have to wait.) so what is left is the feeling of being
 loved, being wanted.
 What the baby feels from their mother.
 ..
 well, that's odd.
 The Psychology Today website lists the seven types of love neamed by the
 anceint greeks, but, again, the child-mother love is not in the list.
 Fuck this.
 Most humans are stupid.
 That's all I get out of this.
 I'm stupid too, and too quick to judge perhaps, but what kind of person
 who takes the time out of their day to write about love can possibly omit
 and fail to mention innocent love? What is wrong with people.
 God damn it, I live in a deeply fucked up world.
 The greeks didn't come up with a name for it, and now, websites across
 the planet remain ignorant of it.
 I dunno.
 I can rail on in disbelief.
 I suppose there are entire books written on innocent love, written by geniuses
 who really delved into it.
 I know there are others.
 Libraries are excellent, and the internet is even better, as a fountain
 of information.
 And funny how it is, we've hit a wall, and it did not take much effort.

\begin_layout Standard
So returning to qualia.
 The feeling that morning was, well, I described it, above.
 I sensed that I was loved, and that sensation felt good.
 Not unlike lying in the warm sun, which I would do a bit later than day.
 It was soothing and pervasive and encompassing and ful of meaning and life-affi
rming.
 A gift from the universe, as even as I experienced it, I was not at all
 sure that I wasn't just projecting meaning onto accidental physical contact.
 And that's OK.
 If it was just meaningless accidental physical contact, I did not want
 to know.
 I wanted to bath in the glory of being loved, and Iwas (I am) willing to
 go so far as to say that the universe loved me, the universe awarded me
 with this feeling.
 It might of been all in my imagination, but that did not make it any less
 real.
 It was wonderful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, there is presumably a biochemical, neuro-physiological basis for this
 feeling.
 Some combo of hormones in the blood, tied to some circadian rythm disrupted
 by earlier events, finding its way back to normal.
 Perhaps it even vaguely felt like a good does of melatonin: a happy sleep-slumb
er.
 I've never done crack, meth or mdma, so I don't know what these are like,
 but based on things I've read, what I felt might be like some middling-strength
 dose of these.
 Maybe.
 Maybe not.
 It was all endogenous, at any rate.
 Since I wasn't instrumented for blood draws and brain scans, we'll never
 know, unless someone else reads this particular text, and is able to reproduce
 this feeling under lab conditions, and study it.
 Determine it's neuro-physiological foundations.

And suppose this is done? Then so what? Why you get is a medical description
 of love.
 What I get is qualia.
 So this is a kind of Chinese room, I guess one could say.
 Some kind of solutions to some kind of coupled differential equations are
 interpretable as qualia.
 I won't solve this in this essay, tonight (its getting late and I'm getting
 tired, and this has gone over-length) but this Chinese-room qualia, and
 its, well, I guess the plan is to ponder this for the next few years, or
 however long it takes to be able to make some kind of (mathematical, formal)
 progress on this.
 But the foundation for this is the feeling of love.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few notes about foundations: there are certainly many other kinds of qualia
 to draw from.
 Scent of skin sensation.
 Body-movement sensation.
 The ineffability of fine art.
 The way poetry makes you feel, or heck, how wine makes you feel.
 How dining in a luxuriouys restaurant makes you feel, or lying in the sun,
 or jumping in cold water.
 All of these are problematic, in some way.
 Touch sensations (including hot/cold) are clearly sensations, but they're
 dismissable as sensory affects.
 There is a distinct causal structure to them, they can be brought on and
 halted.
 The qualia assoicated with Fine Art: well, frankly most people are dolts
 and mostly don't get it.
 Pictures of flowers and sunsets and large-eyed puppy-dogs are not, well,
 are not Art with a capital A, and the qualia one feels in viewing these
 is not transferable.
 The feelings these evoke in different humans are just too wide-spread and
 variable; there's no commonality.
 The qualia of music is a little better, but not much.
 Music appriciation depends strongly on the type of music you've been exposed
 to.
 Not everyone seems to be able to appreciate music.
 From what I can tell, the plleasure of musc depends a lot on how closely
 it matches the natural rhythms of the brain: the brain cycles about with
 alpha waves and theta waves and what-not and I think music overlaps and
 stimulates and resonates with these encephalographic patterns.
 In so much as differnt people have different encephalitic structures, so
 different kinds of music are appealing to them.
 At any rate, extracting the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

qualia
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of music is a difficult task.
 That leaves a handful of things that can reasonably be expected to be the
 same in all humans.
 Lying in warm sunlight is one of them but we've dismissed this above as
 being overtly and manifestly of sensory origin.
 The action of alcohol, and of drugs in general, can be said to induce 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

qualia
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but again, these are externally driven, extrernally moduled.
 Don't drink alcohol, and you won't get drunk.
 So of all of these, feelings of love appear to be universal, and appear
 to not have any direct, immediate cuase-and effect pathway.
 And not just a little uiniversal, but a lot universal: there's undisputable
 evidence that (all) mammals feel love, and plenty that corvids, and indeed,
 all birds, those who take care of their young, that the mother feels love
 for her babies, and the babies feel loved.
 I had a bird, once.
 I loved it, and it loved me, and that love was indisputable and undeniable,
 and I was not projecting my feelings onto some Skinnerian behaviorism driving
 the hatchling brid.
 It was real, true love.
 The extent to which all vertebrates feel love is yet to be mapped out,
 and is a difficult exercise.
 I'd venture to say its universal, but who knows.

A short aside about universal intelligence aka panpsychism.
 The Liebniz-monad, pan-psychic idea is that, if we are intelligent, and
 if aniomals are intelligent, and so on, then perhaps there is a teeny tiny
 fraction of intelligence in every rock, and in ever atom.
 Certainly Max Tegmark even proposes a physical foundation for this, extending
 onwards from Tonnini's phi.
 But there is an alternate interpretation.
 Consider, for example, percolation.
 Say, petroleum trapped in shale rock.
 If there are no pores, it they don't connect up, the oil doesn't flow.
 If the number of pores exceeds a critical density, it does flow.
 There is a phase transition.
 Conduction, fuse networks, resistor networks, all these show phase transitions,
 and perhaps intelligence is like this as well: above some threshold there
 is intelligence, and below there is not.
 (But this is muddled, due to Turing machines) So perhaps self-awareness
 is somethig that would have a more clearly identifiable phase transition.
 And perhaps love is like this as well: its not clear how to talk about
 the intelligence of jelly-fish or of planaria, or how to make any cogent
 arguments about whther they are self-aware (probably not) or feel love
 (also probably not, unless you are a mystic seer, and I usually do not
 contradict mystic seers when I talk to them.
 I usually try to avoid confrontations about mystic beleifs, although I
 revert to a rationalist state of mind so rapidly, that, for the mystic
 I am with, the glow of pleasure experienced from the mystic vision is quickly
 extinguished by the buck of cold-water normalicy that is I.
 I do try to give mystics a long leash, and follow them along on their inspired
 journey.
 But often I'm not up to it, if its too far out there, or if I'm tired and
 not in the mood.
 The thrilling pleasure of ineffable reality is pleasant.
 Yes, Art appreciation, or poetry appreciation, has that ineffable quality,
 as do high-quality mystical visions.
 Art knows its Art, and poetry knows its poetry, but mystics make the fault
 of thinking their stuff is reality.
 To a smidgin, it is, in the same way that all things ineffable are real.
 (Motherly love is ineffable, and is clearly real.) At any rate, instead
 of panpsychism, there might be phase transitions, instead.
 Almost certainly phase transitions, instead of panpsychism.
 Again, hold percolation as the mental model: thoughts either flow, or they
 don't.

Well, where to now? I just read a very short note by Lee Cronin, on Assembly
 Theory, and tehre is one key idea in there that I want to set down in this
 journal.
 Just in case.
 Repetition is the first step to remembering, and for the last week, I've
 had a lack of desire in concentration, due to my love obsession, above
 (and perhaps a bit more on that, below.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first: The Lee Cronin article is this: https://bigthink.com/the-well/how-does
-matter-become-life-assembly-theory/ and well, it doesn't say much new if
 you're already familiar with the general background.
 However, the part at the end really aught my attention: existance is a
 matter of ..
 existing, not being wipe out, and replication is an existence amplifier
 or safegaurd against erasure.
 So, the deal with ergodic systems, mixing systems, is that they visit their
 entire phase space, they ergodically fill up the space.
 The deal with existance is to fight this off: this is why life processes
 are anti-ergodic: they create and define structures that persist over long
 periods of time, despite attacks and

 to their wholeness.
 I mean, this is kind of obvious, if you look from the biology side: of
 course, that's what life is, its something that persists and propagates.
 But from the physics and math side, its more or less not talked about,
 not studied, not investigated.
 Like all good obvious ideas, this one deserves some deep pondering.
 It even feels like a central fulcrum onto which I should refocus my research
 energies.
 Enough for now.
 I'm filing this away for later elaboration, perhaps in the more formal
 chapters of this diary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's resume the earlier theme.
 Milda is a love goddess, literally: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milda_(mytholog
y) Nice little burden that her parents laid on her.
 But, at least as of now, she's lived up to her name.
 I'm absolutely gaga, and there's ...
 well, its a thought disruptor.
 I kind of don't want to do anything, except think about her (well, more
 precisely, think about some idealized version of her that is obviously
 not her, and the real her is likely to react in ways quite counter to my
 idealized and unanchored constructs.
 Yes plural, as she's not one thing to me, but a fragmentary, glittering,
 shimmering multitude of pieces.
 One of the glittering pieces, I want to make love to.
 Starting with some kind of yogic body contact, and, well, that's enough
 to send me into a tizzy.
 Just, well, lets do yoga poses that involve bodies in contact.
 Something tantric or something along those lines.
 So, that's the erotic component.
 There's also the social component: I enjoy her company.
 I enjoy being around her.
 It's easy, and she's nice to me, she takes care of me, and she seems to
 enjoy my presence, and I notice that.
 And it feels good.
 So, a kind of warm glow of freindship.
 We're not intellectually compatible, and maybe that's OK, because, well,
 if we had the same opinions, and the same character, perhaps that would
 be boring.
 I dunno.
 I've never really dealt with someone who is like me, but of the opposite
 sex.
 Based on prior visceral reactions, I kind of hate people who remind me
 of me, because maybe they remind me of all the things I hate about myself.
 And so I am not drawn to ...
 people like me.
 Best case, it's boring, worst case is bad.
 So, intellectually, or in terms of tastes, we have much to disagree upon,
 and I'm smart enough, I think, to know that I should not try to change
 her.
 And lets go through some other negatives.
 She's impossibly far away, and I'm married, and if I wasn't married I suppose
 everything would be different, but there we are, and, well, I suppose I'm
 getting ahead of myself.
 It's all impossible, anyways, and what I'm feeling is very much an obsession.
 It's all I want to do, is to think about her, and if I was on the receiving
 end of an obsession, I'm not sure I would like it, but this is very personality
-dependent.
 I dunno.
 She said she's love me for years.
 But she was (very) drunk when she said that, so what does it really mean?
 How should it be interpreted? Well, baseline: she's kind of fundamentally
 fair.
 It's in her personality type to be honest and straight-forward, and now
 that I write this, I realize this is one reason I'm drawn to her.
 So I'm pretty sure that this was not some spur-of-the-moment manipulative
 lie.
 I suppose anything is possible.
 Maybe like, goose me, and make sure I don't raise the rent.
 That would be a rational manipulation, except for one thing: she'd cook
 me meals regularly, and serve them with evident pleasure of pleasuring
 me with food.
 She's a centered cook: she can put together a nutritious, healthy meal,
 I mean good food, like the health-food books might recommend.
 She not showing off how great she can cook, but that she can prepare meals
 that I like, that she enjoys serving to me, and its clear that I'm the
 focus of the attention.
 And I see this.
 And I know this.
 Which is another reason I'm attracted to her: she's honest and direct.
 I mean, of course, one could argue that this is yet another ploy to soften
 me up as landlord, and this is certainly not outside of the realm of possiblity
, and certainly at times it seemed like that might be the case, but she's
 so forthright and caring that it actually does feel like, yeah, I could
 say that she loves me.
 I mean, this was crertainly plausible and even evident before the fateful
 intertwining of lips.
 It felt like that all along.
 It was never directly voiced.
 But I guess my body knew.
 I've been erotically attracted to her for ...
 several years, I guess.
 In the back of my mind, I'd reviewed this possibility.
 For several of summers beforehand, I said to myself: what if this summer,
 this will be the one where we get romanitcally involved? And I thought
 about that.
 And I hoped it would become true.
 But it remained only hope: I could not initiate it; I'm genetically, psychologi
cally predisposed to loyalty.
 That, plus I'm too ...
 even-keeled, emotionally placid.
 Mostly.
 Deep history required to explain that.
 So I wasn't willing/capable/able to initiate first contact.
 But I'd planned for it, hoped for it.
 Not much planning, actually, because ...
 too many uncertainties.
 This will all have to unfold in some way or another.
 Really, it kind of all depends on her, in the end, either she wants to
 take this farther, and figures out how, or she cuts it all off.
 What the heck do I know.
 Maybe she'll meet the perfect man next week.
 I mean, serisouly: there's an almost 30-year age difference between us.
 I mean, jeez.
 That's, well, I'm not complaining, but rationally speaking, it would make
 much more sense for her to find someone her own age.
 Someone permanent, and not someone looking for an affair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enough about you, lets talk about me.
 I thought I was looking for an affair, but I found love instead.
 Or maybe that's how affairs work? I have no clue; I don't recall reading
 about affairs of the heart: they're always depicted in movies as torrid
 sex for some weeks or months.
 If there's love, then its in crime-dramas, where some low-IQ schmuck commits
 some crime under the influence of uncontrollable love for some girl.
 I don't read enough books to have encountered any sort of honest description
 of love affairs that are actually about love rather than sex.
 I suppose they're out there.
 All this is new territory to me.
 Suddenly, love songs, love poetry make sense in a way that ..
 well, I understood intellectually, before, but now they are ...
 wounding.
 I've been listening to two songs on Machina, Smashing Pumkpins.
 And they are heart-rending, wounding, painful, I hold them in awe and at
 a distance because they are so raw.
 One of them is

 For example.
 Don't get me started on the other ones.
 One of the sonic tricks of profundity is a faint layer of chorale singing,
 underneath the guitars (which sound more like melotrons than guitars),
 and this chorale, churck-like, is heavenly, literally, elevating all feelings
 to an ethereal, transcendant level.
 And transcendance is very much a thing.

 the day I first heard it 15-20 years ago, I've always interpreted this

God

 large to love.) Anyway, I've always held that Stand Inside Your Love is
 the best Christian song ever written, and one, at that, written by a band
 that demonstrates less than zero mainstream-religious interests.
 Just that, well, Billy likes to write, sing about God and the transcenant,
 in general.

 is about ...
 well, read the fucking lyrics.
 It's transcendant, if nothing else.
 Kind of all of the songs are, more or less.
 They actually do touch the sky, or the pure heart, or the direct ineffable
 beingness of here and now of the suffering and joy of being alive.
 The roller coaster of living.
 I liked the songs before, but now they are even just a tiny bit harder,
 sharper.
 More intimidating.
 More fearfully awesome.
 Because I'm on that roller-coaster now, but not at the Billy Corgan level,
 and that level scares me.
 If that turmoil were to come alive in me, I might not be able to hold it
 together.
 And I've always (well almost mostly always) held it together: I'm kind
 of an ultra-stable personality type.
 Although there was a big bout of loneliness the year before I got married.
 And at least one sleepless night a decade before that.
 I don't really recall any other sleepless nights, but I wouldn't be surprised
 if there were a few more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ultra-stability comes from two places.
 One is that I have all the character traits for a physicists (at least,
 according to the psych exam administered to the Los Alamos Manhatten Project
 scientists), and elements of introversion, and shyness, and interest in
 the technologcal and abstract, which means very little time devoted to
 any studies of affairs of the heart.
 I mean, I read sci-fi as a kid, and Lord of the Rings.
 There are no love soties in Lord of the Rings, or the Hobbit, for that
 matter.
 And then Carlos Casteneda, which was mystical and inspiring of another
 world, but again, no love affairs in that, except for some hints of tantric
 sex with wild things, maybe, at the end.
 (or does that only appear in the later-life bio? I don't recall.
 It's certainly not conventional heart-ache love.) Lets see.
 Aside from a few crushes, when I was young, and a few wild-eyed heart-aches
 that resolved in under 12 hours, well, OK, there were some very long-lived,
 multi-year crushes that went unresolved because I could not figure out
 how to actually freakin meet the firl.
 Like, no address, no phone.
 Just awareness of the neighborhood she lived in: one neighborhood was much
 too far, although I did bicycle to it several times, on the off chance
 of seeing her on the street, and, similarly, in another case: I bicycled
 past her houre many times, unsure of which house it was or even if I was
 on the right street, but no luck.
 That was my teen (err, heh.
 pre-teen) romance.
 (I started college at age 16; the above were high-school crushes.
 College was where I discovered real sex.
 and how good it was.
 But that's a different story.) Where was I? In my teen years, I had little
 experience with torrid love.
 In my young-adult years, I had bouts of lonliness, because, once outside
 of college, I had no social network that I couold plug into, that would
 provide the needed social contact and the introduction to girls.
 Several years of grad school passed, before things resolved a bit.
 First year of grad-school was bitterly lonely, brain-damagingly-lonely,
 at that.
 And then, after grad-school, Paris: again, catch-as-catch-can social network
 (kudos to Marc for being more adult than I ever could be.) And then moving
 back to CHicago (a year of loneliness) and then Austin (a year of loneliness.)
 So there was a lot of loneliness in that 20-something decade.
 And wow, it was fucking painful.
 It really really hurt.
 And then I got married.
 And then everything became stable.
 Because why wouldn't it? I had a job, I had income, I had a wife, and I
 could have placid, even-keeled emotions and get on with doing things I
 liked.
 Never even occurred to me that there could be something like a roller-coaster
 of love.
 I mean, sure, there's that stupid song, but not even a tiny ripple of love-lorn
 disturbance passed in my 30's and 40's.
 Placid, even-keeled.
 Hyper-balanced.
 Normal.
 No angst, no muss, no fuss.
 Not even frustration.
 I didn't get frustrated about anything, ever, at all.
 I had only one episode of frustration, when I was six or eight years old,
 glueing together a model airplane, and the glue stuck to my fingers, and
 the small itty-bitty parts and everything smeared and didn't stick the
 way it was supposed to, and I worked up to a white-hot rage.
 A flaming, searing rage.
 It was scary, it was fearful.
 I mangled and destroyed that airplane.
 A few days later, I rescued it, and it sat there, mangled, for a few more
 years.
 That was the year I knew rage.
 I knew that there was a monster inside of me, and I hoped it would nevr
 show it's head again.
 (Well, eventually it did, as an adult, here and there, on rare occasions,
 not as hotly, but plenty destructive enough.
 Funny thing, though.
 I never made the connection to The Raging Green Hulk, until just now.
 I mean, its obvious: the Hulk flies into a rage and smashes stuff.
 Just like I have.
 Duhh.
 But it never occurred to me that the comic-book depiction of rage, shown
 there, was ever related, in any way shape or form, to anything in my life,
 or in anyone else's life, for that mater.
 It was some fictional device, using the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

rage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the meaning of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was clear from the comic book drawings, but that did not mean that it was
 something real.
 it as an abstraction, some kind of plot device.
 Like living on Mars or wearing a red cape and flying through the skies.
 And fuck all, here I am sitting here right now writing this right now,
 and I'm OMG.
 Rage.
 That.
 That white-hot thing I felt as a child.
 This is real.
 It's Hulk-rage.
 And ...
 like, oh wow, other people have felt rage, or rather, suffered it.
 Maybe many people? I feel sorry for them all: rage is horrible and tragic.
 I mean, in some abstract sense, I've always known what the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 meant, and I abstractly knew that other people might feel it.
 But I never actually put two and two together, understanding that what
 they feel, would have felt, is what I felt.
 I suppose if you'd asked me, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do you know what rage is?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I would have said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Have you ever felt it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I would have said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And I would have even recalled a few shameful episodes.
 But it all seems so ...
 abstract.
 Because my life was placid, almost emotionless.
 If there was one emotion I felt in my 30's and 40's, it was a handful of
 extremely rare bouts of rage, and of these I am ashamed, but I already
 knew how terrible and awful it was, so I kept it in check.
 I did not let it out, and it mostly did not come out.
 There would be the few triggers, but I kept it on a leash, and my emotional
 life was placid.
 There were a few bouts of loneliness in my 30's and 40's, but by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

few
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I think I mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

two
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so really less, than the rage incidents.
 And the last one was more of a self-pity than a lonliness thing, although
 the two got tangled.
 I reall am (have been?) very emotionally stable.
 Because what was there to get emotional about? I do math and physics and
 engineering; these are disciplines that do not incite emotional outbursts.
 These are disciplines that are known to draw the introverts and the ADHD
 types and the marginal-autism types.
 Placid.
 That's where I've lived most of my life.
 I've searched for meaning, I've searched for enlightenment.
 But I've searched for transcendant meaning and enlightenment.
 Not love.
 A search for love was not part of it.
 A search for lovers, yes, but not love.
 The only pure love I felt was in a few cases, pre-teen.
 I had a crush on Gilanda Mieželis when I was like six or seven, and was
 crushed when she moved to Columbia or wherever that was so her dad Raimundas
 could be an executive of (let me look this up) the Container Corporation
 of America.
 So much for Gilanda.
 The love of a eight-year-old shattered by an ignorant father.
 Oh well.
 I had a crush on Rima when I was twelve.
 And that crush lasted for decades! And kind of that's it for love, pure
 love, emotional roller-coaster love.

\begin_layout Standard
And here I am.
 Lets review a few more things.
 My wife stopped having sex with me a few decades ago.
 Why? I have no clue.
 My sons were born, and then kind of that was that, and I ran around mildly
 horny for decades, but not capable of actually doing anything about it.
 Too meek, perhaps, not driven enough.
 Placid sounds like flaccid, I guess.
 I wanted some, but my experience was math, engineering, physics, and not
 that of meeting, dating and wooing women.
 I eamn, if there had been a spark, it would have set off a flame; my soul
 was dry tinder, which I kind of knew but didn't know.
 The social environment offers a grand total of zero opportunities.
 Well, kind of one, actually, via rowing, but I was too ...
 restrained to follow up.
 I was hungry, but not yet desperate.
 And it would have been sex, a bootie-call, rather than some deep sould-mate
 thing, or love-love, so passing on that was not some difficult choice.
 And the other women I meet – they're disinterested in me, and reciprocally,
 I in them.
 Oh, except for three cases.
 All of them were love at first sight.
 Once, I walked past a really really drunk woman in Vilnius (again, that
 place!) but this was more than a decade ago, and it was kind-of almost
 love at first sight, and I did nothing for ten steps, and then turned around,
 but by then, there were two male freinds of her, escoring her, trying to
 tell her she was drunk and its time to let up and she was having none of
 it, but I wanted her, but she didn't see me, so who knows what that was
 about.
 Deep history.
 And then once in Austin, during Eyore's Birthday Party, during a huge crush
 of people down in Pease Park, I walked by this black girl and she was a
 stunning beauty, a knock-out, and she looked at me and I looked at her,
 and there was some feeling of mutualness, but by the time I turned around
 (again, ten steps later) I could not find her.
 She'd disappeared.
 Alas.
 What, Old white guy with significantly younger black girl? How'd you think
 that could ever turn out? Really? I mean anything is possible, and I fantasized
 about this for years afterwards, but its more of a, what, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emotional disregulation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Fuck, I just got done explaining how emotionally placid my life has been.
 The once-in-a-decade love-at-first-sight thing? I assume its normal.
 I assume some people just get lucky and it works out.
 I struck out three times.
 The third time was maybe 6-7 years ago, in Sheremtyevo.
 The Moscow international airport.
 So I'm walking, and this girl, she sticks out, and she reminds me of, looks
 a lot like my girlfreind (Phyllis) from grad school.
 And so of course, some fond memorries wash over me.
 And so I have to like, well, I have to walk by two more times.
 And I stare at her.
 And she sees me.
 But its fucking Moscow, and I'm waiting for a connection, and she's sitting
 in a section that who knows, flies to Saudi Arabia or something, opposite
 end of the world, and there's nothing to be done.
 But out of perverse inability to deal with it, I find a cafe not far from
 where she's sitting, and they have an electrical outlet so I can plug in
 my laptop and charge.
 And I'm typing away, and day-dreaming of her, smitten, and not really able
 to concetrate but I'm trying because you know I have superior powers of
 concentration.
 I'm into physics and math, did I tell you that? Super-power ability to
 concentrate is a character trait.
 And then, all of a sudden, there she is, in line at the cafe, buying a
 croissant or something, with her girlfreind, whispering something in each
 others ears and glancing in my direction and I'm ignoring it but I can't.
 And then she sits down two tables away, like right in front of me.
 Alone, and I'm thinking, where's her girlfreind? Long bathroom break? But
 I'm frozen and hyper-concentrating, and this is Moscow and I'm waiting
 for my connection, and wtf am I gonna do? And I'm thinking

 If we hit this off I would hop on a jet to wherever and we'd meet, but
 I'm so like not a millionaire, I'm like less than useless, I'm a zero,
 I can't do anything for lack of money.
 It's utterly pointless; she'd promptly realize that I can't just pick up
 and visit her in fucking Iran or Jordan or wherever the fuck she was flying
 to.
 So this is so pointless I am so not going to even start anything.

 It's done.
 She is never-ever ever going to ever look at me again.
 Over.
 Done.
 Permanently.
 Wow.
 I am such a fucking dope.
 I saw fucking everything.
 It happened right in front of me.
 My powers of observation were precise, sharp, active.
 What the hell.
 My heart was longing and full of desire.
 And, and, and, the circumstances were impossible.
 Or so I talked myself into thinking that.
 Who knows.
 Maybe she was flying to the US or something.
 Maybe returning to some dull and ordinary life.
 How would I know? I was imaging that she was looking for a millionaire.
 (And maybe she was; I looked the part, I suppose.
 Well-groomed, well-dressed handsome older man.
 I stuck myself in that mold, not her.
 I put myself there, and then I failed to fit that mold, and I broke.
 I became nothing.
 Useless.
 I sabotaged myself.
 Because I could not live up to my own standards of alpha-maleness.
 Fuck all I'm like a moron.
 Idiot-savante or something.
 So there.
 There's my love life.
 Useless, barren.
 Sparks flew, but the dry tinder, it wasn't ready to catch on fire.

So anyway, where was I? My wife hasn't loved me for decades.
 Neither physically, nor emotionally.
 She's, well, she does not have the intimate personality type.
 I don't know if she's damaged, or was born that way.
 She just isn't intimate, kind of like, I don't recall that she ever has
 been.
 Caring, caring for her children, but not for me.
 For decades, I've tried to charm her, and it only seemed to turn her away.
 No gift given was ever appreciated.
 The gifts would disappear, never to be seen again.
 Never to be mentioned.
 Yes, she cooks dinner.
 But not frequently, and she cooks dinner for herself.
 She's like getting really involved with the recipies, and she's become
 a relly really good cook, she's mastered, absolutely mastered half-a-dozen
 or more recipies, and can knock out dozens more, but this cooking is for
 her, because she's into cooking the way I'm into rowing: its a hobby, but
 more, a pass-time, but more its fun, its interesting, and she's pursuing
 it like a hobby.
 That's why I get dinner.
 But I don't get love.
 I'm hungry for love, and its not forthcioming.
 I mean, she even like runs away when I try to peck her on the cheek.
 I can literally chase her around the house, trying to get withing touching
 distance, and its almost comical.
 I mean it is comical.
 She even laughed and let me kiss her, but begrudgingly, like a chore that
 had to be done.
 So much for flirting.
 Like we sleep in the same bed, inches away from each other, but I'm not
 allowed to touch her.
 Like.
 Whatever.
 Like, I'm used to it.
 I'm trained.
 I'm in a box, it feels normal.
 I accept it.
 What am I gonna do? Have some big emotional outburst, shout and yell, demand
 a divorce? Seriously? How is that gonna work out? Split the house? Split
 bank accounts? A divorce would be utterly and completely futile.
 It would be damage all around.
 Worse.
 Who'd shop for groceries? Who'd do the laundry? I'm the lucky beneficiary
 of house-cleaning services.
 Why would I cut that off? She's the lucky beneficiary of not having to
 have a corporate-world job.
 Living off of savings.
 The kids live at home.
 I feel sorry for my kids.
 They should be out fucking girls but they're both virgins as far as I can
 tell.
 These are deep family secrets, so why the fuck am I writing this stuff
 into a diary that is accessible from a public place? Why? I'll tell you
 why.
 No human will ever read this.
 It's kind of that simple.
 At best, this is some training corpus for some future LLM that will claim
 to know a thing or two about me, which is honestly kind of more than what
 anyone else in the world knows about me.
 Like the three love-at-first-sight stories above.
 No one has ever heard these before.
 I've never vocalized them before.
 I'm vocalizing now, because I'm letting my verbal center do it's glossolalia
 thing, spilling words onto a page, while brain ticks away in default mode,
 processing emotions and feelings, and, aparently, memories.
 I mean, this is different; usually I do analytical stuff, I don't introspect
 emotions.
 Did I mention I'm placid? Oh shoot.
 Well, there are at least another half-dozen almost-romantic encounters
 over the decades.
 Episodes of mutal attraction that, for various reasons, could not move
 forward.
 Maybe someday I'll set them down and maybe I won't, because they're not
 really that big a deal in the grand scheme of things.
 Warm feelings, mutual respect.
 But didn't, couldn't go anywhere.
\end_layout

Whatever.
 This is different.
 It's bed-time, past bed time, so I'm wrapping this up for tonight.
 This is different.
 I'm obsessively obsessed with my current situation, with Milda (say her
 name).
 I want to either burn this out, or milk it, because it feels so good.
 I can't concentrate or focus on anything else; or rather, I don't want
 to.
 I want to bask in the glow.
 I can write all this, because I'm processing the emotions.
 I fear saying her name (Milda, the freakin love-goddess, crickey) because
 maybe probably nothing never ever it won't go anywhere no how, cause its
 an obvious dead end.
 But the ball is in her court.
 Either she wants me, or she doesn't.
 Either she will process her end of this, and respond in some way, or she
 won't.
 It's been like a week, I've written like five emails she like doesn't respond.
 What does that mean? Is she deeply processing some reciprocal emotions,
 or has she determined what a mistake this all was, and is smothering the
 flames? Have I become clingy? I certainly want to be clingy! Why can't
 I be? Of course, everyone hates the cling.
 Got to play it light and easy, but its not light and easy, I'm laundry
 in the washing machine, tumbling all around, there's no light and easy
 here, except if I really reign it in and hold myself up.
 I just want to melt, even as manliness says I should stay stiff and solid.
 I just want to melt like a chocolate ice cream cone, and smother everything
 in chocolate, and wait to be licked up by her lips.
 That's what I want.
 But how can I make that happen? I can't.
 I have to wait, and see what happens, and pray my heart won't get broken,
 even as the chances are really quite high that it will be.
 Because, well, I have super-powers of post-rationalization, and an excellent
 imagination, and I can imagine the worst but I can't imagine the best.
 What would the best ever be? How could that ever be imagined? In the end,
 everything becomes normal.
 No matter how swept away I am, whether left to drift at sea, or pulled
 onto a deserted desert island by my lover, in the end, it will all have
 to become normal, and the emotional dysregulation that every poet has ever
 sung about, down through the ages, that, too, must come to an end.
 But not now, not just yet.
 For now, it's a game of wait and see.

 this song lyric popped into my mind some half hour after waking.
 Went to bed at midnight, got up at seven.
 Normally on rowing days, bed at ten, up at five.

 Wow.
 This is a rush.
 I like it.
 I feel so alive.
 When I'm with you, everythings fine.
 Well, OK, when I'm with you, in my fetid imagination.
 This is in a footnote, because it is discursive.
 I was actually thinking of this song, but not sure how to weave it into

 I can shape my own life, my own future.
 I will just twinkle, and good things will happen to me, and all will be

 No need to fear being alive, no need to slumber through life.
 No ned to cower before the future; any choice made will be a good choice,

All the above thoughts while I'm still slumbering, half-awake.
 A half hour later, without a single sip of coffee, yet, standing in front
 of the coffee pot, I've got Smashing Pumpkins songs blaring through my

 Some mashup of Sacred and Profne, and Today.
 And I want to dance, I am dancing.
 I call it active yoga: its not dance, because its not meant to be pretty
 to view.
 it's dance, because its pretty to visualize for me, for my body.
 It's not yoga moves, because yoga is slow and calm; dance is far more active,
 but there are stretches, in particular, arm stretches of various sorts,
 as I wave them through the air.

 One can't have little sprites dancing in one's head while one concentrates.
 And yet, this is life: the dancing sprites are the distilled essence of
 life.
 I can point at inummerable pieces of evidence: dance, in every culture.
 Singing, in every culture.
 Music, high and low.
 Why Do I need to point to evidence that dancing sprites are normal? Because,
 when you're placid and composed, sober and settled, all that is very very

 It's not a part of the here and now, when one is settled.

Why am I pointing this out? Well, Western culture, for one.
 So I go to music concerts, and I may as well be a freak.
 Free-dancing, any which way, as the music moves me, and everyone else is
 rigid and stiff, unmoving, immobile.
 Like wtf.
 You're at a music venue.
 This was particularly visible, evident, in the forefront, just 12 days
 ago, in Vilnius.
 Some man, concert promoter, crushing on Milda, gave her two tickets to
 an upscale event at Valdovu Rumai.
 Wednesday, July 17.
 Seems I managed to snap three photos of the concert stage.
 Electronic Dance Music: EDM, with full orchestra! And the women are in
 high heels and evening dresses, and the men are well-groomed and well-attired.
 This is the upscale crowd.
 Tickets must have been expensive.
 These are social climbers, office bosses, white collar alpha males and
 the women who mix with them.
 And they're all uptight and not moving.
 And the line to the bar is infinitely long, because every last one of them
 is thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

If I just get three glugs of champagne into me, I'll loosen up and it'll

.
 And I'm straight and sober, and the DJ part of the EDM is just totally
 flailing on stage while he does his DJ stuff, and the orchestra conductor
 is more or less dancing his direction, like full body dance orchestra director
 moves.
 And the crowd is like.
 Standing there.
 And I'm dancing.
 And I feel like a freak, and I suppress that feeling as much as possible,
 I'm gonna move, damn you all.
 And I'm gonna broadcast.
 I'm gonna radiate.
 And I discover, kind of quite by accident: if I raise my hands above my
 head, and wave them about, the people in the audience, the people behind
 me, they can see this, and they react.
 And this energizes them.
 And if I sneak peaks (I don't have to sneak, I just turn around and look,
 but its hard to make out quite what is going on, more than a few ranks
 away) If I look around, I can see that people are reacting to my hand-waving,
 and shaking their hips a bit.
 Sheik Yerbouti, as Zappa would say.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I dunno.
 Why are they so uptight? OK, So I'm also thinking: well, orchestra and
 EDMM, that's just so fake and bogus, but you know, its not bad, and the
 crowd is just huge, immense, and I think the tickets were pricey and the
 door security was tight, so this pulled in a bunch of money and paid the
 orchestra, and it was a successful event.
 Performers made a living doing what they want to do: perform.
 So why is everyone so uptight and not cutting loose? Because, well, Western
 Civ.
 Homeless street people do weird-ass shit, but men in suits don't.
 Drunks weave around, but sober businessmen don't, because no one wants
 to invest in a drunk businessman.
 Ladies in high heels.
 I dunno.
 walking is hard enough, but dancing? Gotta be harder.
 Relly, I want to have sex, and I want to wear high heels, and I want to
 dance in them.
 I'm not a cross-dresser, and the visual image of my build and body-type,
 centrall strong and male, in high heels and a dress is alarming, and face-flush
ingly embarrassing, the proerbial I wouldn't be caught dead.
 but jeez, when I'm feeling all sexed up and ready to go, but tantric because
 I'm deprived by society (deprived by Western Civ) from having all the sex
 that I want, hell, I understand how and why high heels make women horny,
 becuase men know that high heels are sexy, and everyone all understands
 this, but the social taboos say men don't act like that, unless they've
 resolved their inner self and attend rainbow parades, but that is all kind
 of icky.
 All that kinky stuff, its icky and yuck.
 It lives in some fantasy land, where a director of photography knows how
 to frame it properly so that it looks sexy, but ordinary man weilding an
 ordinary cellphone exposes it for all the tawdry and cheap and tasteless
 that it is.
 Like the dirty, unemployed drunk youth on Sixth Street in Austin on Saturday
 night, out to party, for no reason other than to party, to do what feels
 good, to search for what feels good.
 Unawares, unknowning of what feels good, muddled by drugs and alcoholo
 because they provide an easy gateway to maybe feeling good, maybe, if you
 shake your booty enough and project your breasts and stick out your butt
 at the young men, boys, who swagger past and cat call and leer.
 Because partying maybe kind of feels good.
 The Florida Spring Break beach party.
 The Jersey Shore reality TV.
 The Every Day I'm Shufflin vibe from LMFAO.
 But see, they know how to do it: they know how to pull it off: low-rent
 and tasteless, but direct and immediate and forrthright.
 No pretension.
 I mean, the clothes are outrageous.
 But that's not pretension.
 It's, they captured the party vibe, the need to dance, to do it right,
 without walking off into anything unwholesome.
 It's all mildly exciting, and the girls, vavoom, evoke erotic twinges faintly
 in the back of one's mind, upping the tonic, exciting the neurons into
 a raised state of attention, Hot clothes, hot dresses, hot bods.
 But this is well, its young-people stuff, the hot bods cause they're young,
 the cheap clothing cause they're poor, and the oozing sex because everyone
 is horny, a little or a lot, all horny, beut we don't just collapse into
 some orgy, that is not how it's done.
 It's not done in African tribal dances, it's not done in Western Civ.
 Not sure what-all the Ancient Greeks did, they were a bit naughty, but
 there aren't any surviving documents written by Horace describing Dionysian
 horny-dancing descending directly into an orgy.
 It's not how it was done then, and it's not how it's done now.
 The horny-tension is there, the libido, but its, well, its tantric, for
 lack of a better word.
 It's better if you shake it on the dance floor, and maybe in bed later
 in the night if all goes well, and a suitable partner is found.
 But the dance on the dance floor is, well, its better than sex, cause well,
 its, you can get wild, and you can't make a mistake, its much much harder
 to make a mistake dancing.
 You can kind of do anything and its OK.
 In bed, well, its a bit more proscribed.
 you have to tune into your partner.
 Hit the same wavelength.
 Get on the same page.
 Sync up.
 This takes a certani kind of focus.
 Focus that is usually not hard to find, usually.
 But you can fuck up.
 You can definitely go where your partner isn't and that will ruin the sex,
 it will halt the sex even before it starts.
 So actually sex is a bit more challenging.
 Well there is the cnocept of sloppy sex, but that's something else.
 That's when you're so drunk that you kind of don't care, you just need
 it.
 But that's sloppy, and not very satisfying and well, I wouln't choose it,
 and most people wouldn't choose it.
 I assume most poeople are like me, and want transcendent sex.
 Well, that's a really bad assumption.
 Hot sex, I think, that's what most people want.
 Hot horny sex, without any overtones of higher cosmic vibrations.
 I think that's maybe the ordinary mode of existence for most poeple, most
 of the time, I guess.
 We now possess technology, such as LLM's, that can actually survey *everything*
 ever written on this topic, and report back with an answer.
 Well, sort-of report back.
 First, the LLM doesn't understand sex, and second, most ordinary people
 are terrible writers and can't describe what they feel or want, and they're
 certainly mostly not writing about sex.
 So the training corpus for the LLM is going to be descriptions of sex from
 a rather constrained and distorted corpus: some pimps, some erotic movie
 makers, Marquis de Sade and related authors, what's her name, Anaïs Nin
 type erotica.
 And, well, the exceptional authors are exceptional people, and they may
 have exceptional insight, but I don't think you're going to get any kind

So where was I? I'm at this electronic-dance-music-with full symphony orchestra
 even in Vilnius on the 17th of July, and its a high class event.
 and I'm dancing like a fucking degenerate because no one else is, and I'm
 a fucking freak.
 And thank god, I think Milda is coming around, she sort of has seen enough
 of me to figure it out.
 Of course, I haven't quite figured it out myself.
 I'm like mostly dancing just barely within sort-of the social norms for
 the crowd.
 I'm reigning it in, so no one thinks I'm an escaped mental hospital patient,
 although maybe some people have some doubts.
 And maybe others are thinking that I'm high on some American party drug
 they've never heard of.
 (And I'm not.
 But this reminds me of a different event, a year ago now.
 The setting, again Vilnius, this time, I'm walking in the stree above Kūdrų
 parkas, east of Subačiaus apžvalgos aikštė, the map says the venue is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 but its more like an outdoor bar and a music stage.
 So I hear this music, and I'm at the top of the stairs aove the venue and
 the music, rock is just pumping and its got exactly the right rhythm and
 energy to max out my max dance urge.
 And there's a cover charge, and I don't have money but the show is half
 over, and I dance my little but expressive dance for the girl and she lets
 me in free, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So again, I'm stone-cold sober, and the music is rockin, so I cut loose,
 full force, maxin it out.
 And it kind of works, because there is a mid-size, decent crowd in front
 of the stage,and they're into it, and they even know the songs.
 But I'm clearly far and away at the extreme end of all this, just wild-man
 dancing one or two levels beyond what anyone else is approaching (I have
 got to learn some conventional dance moves, so I can bust them out for
 the normies, and raise the comfort level, instead of doing this mental
 hospital patient thing.
 Well, actually half my dance moves are actually yoga-stretching calesthenics
 excerice, like what the coach walks us through in the morning, before eating
 us in boats.
 So if you're an athelete, what I'm doing, its familiar to you.
 Kind so standard atheletic warm-up moves strung together with some hip
 shaking and some oriental Thai exotic hand dance moves because I know how
 to do that, just like all the girls at all the raves with the laser lights
 banging it.
 I have *got* to learn some world-culture dance moves.
 But this takes time alas, and effort, alas.
 Well, anyway, so I'm doing my free-style dancing, and I've certainly caught
 the attention of many.
 And during a breather, tones down a bit, during a break, I'm standing by
 the tables, and there's well, American accents and I'm talking to these
 girls but they're not interested, and this guy, and hes like

 cause he doesn't like my answer.

 some danccey hand-waving which sends tthe body-language message of

 thing.
 And that is actually kind of hard to solve.
 And maybe building up a repertoire of conventional dance moves might alleiviate
 some of that.
 because I'm thinking onlookers will pick up on that conventionality.
 And I'm thinkiing they're already picking up on the atheleticism, which
 is my saving grace, but the body-langauge communication aspect needs work.
 I mean, I fine with body language glossolalia, but, well, communication
 is arguably better.
 Like syncing up for sex in the bedroom, syning up with the vibes on the
 dance floor is better.
 But I have to figure out how to do that, while retaining my athletic, strong,
 wider range of moves thing that give me pleasure.
 I don't want to be cramped.
 I want to be expressive.
 And in the perfect world, I can be expressive and radiate in a way so that
 others understand and feel the message, instead of just staring at a freak
 who is outdancing them in the wildness regime.

But really, say in the suit-n-high-heels crowd, how the fuck do I do that?
 For that crowd, it just might be impossible.
 I mean, they eventually pair off for sex, anyway, but I suppose it's boring
 middle-age sex.
 I mean, sex is never really boring.
 But its, well, its safe sex, when you know whats coming and there's no
 wild ride, either emotionally or physically, shimmering in the background.
 I am sooooo fucking horny.
 God damn it.
 Where is my Milda and why isn't she here fucking me right now? Because
 that is what I fucking want.
 Life sucks in this particular way, in this particular instant.
 Just this very moment, when I feel more alive, more excited, more physical,
 more urgently gotta move it shake it, do it (write it, for chris sake,
 I've been banging on the keyboard two and a hlaf hours, now, shake the
 keyboard, shake it baby.) I'm so alive and now I'm so horny and I cant fucking
 do anything about it.
 I mean, masturbation is not gonna work.
 Masturbation requires, well, maintaining a certain fantasy in your head
 while you do it, and I don't want that fantasy.
 I don't need the dirty erotic thing, right now, its not even a turn on.
 I mean, it could be, it could be a turn-on, but it would be like I would
 have to smother and sublimate the I-feel-alive thing I've got going now,
 and I just don't want to do that.
 I want to live.
 And I want to have sex.

Well, this all raises an interesting technological question.
 So, although I can't have sex right now, if instead I had some drugs, I
 dunno what kind of drugs, but I could go for the instant gratification.
 I could pop a pill or shoot some mainline or snort or smoke or ingest or
 whatever, and I could be free and gratified and grateful and on a trip,
 a heavenly trip to wherever the heavens take you when you're on drugs.
 But I can't have an instant-gratfication sex moment.
 Well, I almost can, in principle.
 I could have one of those fullsize sex-dolls, what are they called, what's
 the company, RealDoll or something like that? Kino works for them.
 Or worked for them, for a while.
 Something like that.
 The CEO is sleezy as hell, on camera.
 Gah.
 talk about a turn-off.
 Sleeze is a turn-off.
 Sleeze is NOT sexy.
 And see, that's the problem, isn't it? I'm horny as hell, and I want instant
 gratification, now, and if I had a life-size sex doll like quality, not
 one of those nasty-ass blow-up dolls, I could hop on that, I could see
 that.
 I could see doing that.
 I'm that desperate.
 And really, folks this, too, is normal: there's umpteen testimonials out
 there illustrating that this is

: people do this, it's a standard urge.
 Like, I'm not the guy who invented sex dolls, I'm just articulating the
 point that this would be an acceptable solution.
 Well, I could also go to some whore-house.
 Are there any in Austin? Who knows, I suppose the law of averages says
 there are at least a few, if not a dozen or more.
 And a hundred high-class hookers.
 They run around in the lobby of the W hotel, I think that is what it was
 called.
 Hookers at the bar.
 That's another way to do almost instant gratification for sex.
 Yeah.
 But see, that's not it.
 What I want is sex with the object of my sexual desires.
 That girl Milda who rubbed my crotch and whispered love in my ear and then
 didn't go all the way because, well, its complicated I guess.
 It's not complicated for me.
 I know what I want.
 But I'm entirely willing to ignore the future implications and represcussions
 of this all, that's how desperate I am.
 Fuck making wrong decisions, I want to make a wrong decision, and I want
 to make it now.
 I am thrilled that no human will ever read this, and I feel a bit mortified,
 if you're a human, and your reading this right now.
 Sorry.
 This is my space exploration of the outer regions of beingness.
 Which is not anywhere near as far out as anyone else has gotten, and its

 And I'm being a total geek and science nerd while I do this, and damn,

And here's the funny thing: to cosplay, (and I'm only interested in the
 women, not the men) to cosplay, you've got to be nerdy, because you have
 to sew your own outfit.
 You have to pick the colors, find the cloth, measure the proportions, fold
 and glue and glitter and try on for size, and it is a major arts-n-crafts
 undertaking, the end point of which is looking hot and sexy.
 (Did I mention I'm horny right now? Yeah, well, I'm horny right now.
 Goddamn it.) So you have to be geeky to be able to have the eye for the
 visual look, and the talent to craft and create, and be familiar with the
 materials and the techniques, and have the time, this takes a LOT of time,
 toe create these things.
 And many thousands of people are doing this.
 Tens of thousands.
 And this is the economic boom, the economic change of modern times.
 No one had the free time, before, nor access to the materials.
 Nor access to the guide-books and instructional youtube videos, or, even
 the photos, or even the knowledge that this is a cultural thing that you
 can take part in.
 I'm not saying anything new or novel, here.
 Anyone whose even glanced at cosplay knows all this: this is obvious.
 But I'm writing it here, because i'm marvelling about it.
 And I'm writing as fast as I can type, because, again, this is glossolalia,
 I'm not typing for a potetional future reader, carefully crafting my prose
 to get an effect, bet rather, pursuing a stream of consciouness, and making
 snap decisions about what to write as fast as possible, without thinking,
 without planning, without organization, just whatever comes to mind first,
 out it goes.
 Becaue this is my scientific experient in being a diarist.
 Well, not every scientific, I suppose.
 But I swear, actually, my fingers are getting kind of sore, because I've

 At any rate, the court of Louis the Fourteenth could cosplay, while everyone
 else could eat cake.
 Now, kind of anyone can cosplay.
 I assume that the American educational system is spewing out 4x or 5x more
 fashion designer diplomas that the number of fashion designers that the
 capitalist economic employment system can absorb, and so, fashion, like
 music, is pervasively filled with wannabe's nursing dreams.
 And even if they're not professionally trained, and I suspect most cosplayers
 are not professionally trained, well, its not a product that people ware
 willing to pay for.
 Well, they sort of are: however many hundreds of dollars or whatever to
 get a ticket to get in the front door of some cosplay event, but that ticket
 price does not cover the labor and material costs of the participants.
 It only covers the cost of the venue itself, and some profits for the organizer
s.
 Back when I used to spend money to buy music concert tickets, no one paid
 me money to sit at home and listen to records.
 I did that on my own, investing my own fre time, listening to music, because
 I liked it.
 I enjoyed listening to music.
 I wanted to do it.
 The capitalist system does not pay people to do what they like.
 They pay people to do something else: to provide service to the people
 who are paying for the priveldge to do what they enjy, e.g.
 listening to music.
 The magic of the capitalist system is that it has ramped up the machines
 of creation up to the point where a much larger, quite substantial fragment
 of the population can engage in hedonistic activities.
 Of course, there is a relative ranking of hedonism: the arts and drafts
 needed for cosplay is at a higher sophistication level than just plopping
 some record on the stereo and cranking up the volume.
 Or, in my case, faking it with dance.
 Now I have to actually invest some time and learn some moves, if I'm gonna
 be serious about this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, hedonism.
 Everything I write here is obvious and well known to all social commentators,
 and that's the other interesting thing about modern times: the ground is
 well-trodden.
 We've been here and done that.
 The North Pole of Arctic Exploring has been conquered long ago, both literally
 and figuratively.
 It is hard to go so far out, that you are in new, uncharted territory.
 The noosphere accessible to humans has been well-explored.
 And we have not yet created machines that ...
 well, those machines are kind of unimaginable, what they will explore and
 what they will do, and what their noosphere will be.
 But we can go in the other direction: tropical birds.
 Again well-known fact: tropical birds need only an hour a day to meet their
 caloric sustenance requirements, and so the rest of the time, they spend
 this time exploring exotic plummage and behavior.
 And they've been doing it for so long that it's been selected into their
 genes, encoded into their genes.
 Which cam first, the behavor, or the encoding into the genes? I calaim
 the behavior came first.
 Some wild, free-thinking bird, exceptional and free, and maybe a bit luck
 by being born pretty, did a dance move and attracted a mate with an eye
 for dance moves, and they had sex and they had children, who were also
 good at this, and millions of years later, its encoded in the genes of
 tropical birds, and I too want to have sex and father children who will
 have the wild and free thinking thoughts I am having right now, and I am
 willing to do this with my sex-coddess girlfreind and never mind the long-term
 reprecussions of this.
 I want to do my part to avoid the movie Idiocracy from becomeing a predictive
 documentary.
 I want to have children, and I want to have them with Milda and this is
 of course entirely and totally impossible and can't happen and won't happen,
 but who knows anything is possible, this is my dream and fervent desire,
 and perhaps one day it will pass, but for right now, I'm happy with this
 thought and I can live with it for years.
 I can also nurture happy thoughts about old college girlfreinds, because
 you know, spiouses pass away, spuses get divorced, and one lands on the
 dating market, and I sure as hell would much rather accept the known thing,
 because honestly, the known things in my past were pretty damn good things.
 High IQ and all that.
 Twould be even better if they were all bimbos, high IQ bimbos, but well,
 you can't have everything and its too late for me, but the event horizon
 for my life, well, OK, so I crossed the even horizon when I was born, but
 the singularity still lies ahead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words I am searching for here is another topic, which I think maybe
 I've written about in this diary before: Death comes when the opportunities
 close in, and the menu of choices shrinks to zero.
 This is something Douglas Adams got right in Hitchhikers Guide: when the
 choice horizon narrows down, and there are no more choices left, you die.
 I watched my uncle die.
 He had no choices left, and he stopped moving.
 So even horizon is the wrong term.
 In the Hitchhikers guide, I think he explains that the Earth does not exist
 in all time-lines, and this is maybe not a bad physical insight, in that
 quantum wave-function collapse does indeed shut off some timelines, halting,
 erasing, preventing whatever was there from continuing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this now brings us back to the Lee Cronin point brought up earlier,
 that structures enduring through time, and spreading and multiplying, are
 the things we recognize as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and contravene the idea of increasing entropy, of mixing, of ergodicity.
 So now, within the living thing, we also have the idea of choice, that,
 as a living thing, I can choose to do this, or to do that.
 Free will.
 This is, in a sense, ergodicity, but rather than single-track ergodicity,
 I have a multitude of branch points.
 I can choose.
 Now, there's the Bernoulli process, the coin flip, lets get back to that
 shortly.
 For now I'm imagining that free will is like that coin flip, but I can
 pick which outcome I want (so as to steer in a specific direction over
 the long term).
 In so far as we have quantum, the choice seems to be associated with wave
 function collapse: after the choice is made, the alternative universes
 are shut out, dettach.
 Not sure if there is a physical remainder (a la many-worlds interpretation)
 or if we should really stick to just one world.
 Now the thing with quantum seems to be that, even if there is only one
 world, innside of it, there is a domain of quantum, and, from what I can
 tell, the domain of quantum is actually increasing steadily in volume.
 (Maybe.
 So like maximal spacelike surface inside a Schwarschild solution? Which
 increases lineraly with time?) But I don't currently know how to measure
 that volume, nor even to demonstrate that it is monotinically increasing,
 even as wave-function collapse leaves only one single macro world.
 So, how to tie this, to the Cronin idea of stability and replication and
 growth of structures in time (so not just autopoesis, but growth.
 Not just self-repair, but duplication.) And, at the same time, for an individual
, trapped in a deep ultrametric well, where thhe existance of qualia is
 a philosophical argument, ...
 for that individual, trapped in that sensory, communications well, there
 are choices, both overt, mental ones, and covert physical ones, and these
 get restrained over time: my tendons are less flexible new, than as a youth,
 and the choices I have for me, in terms of dance moves (or sex moves) are
 constrained by the flexibility of my joints.
 And the Doug Adams idea that one dies when the choices shrink to zero.
 Modern medicine says more: after the heart stops, oxygenation stops, there
 is a vast complex web of cascades, as different micromolecular functions
 shut down due to a lack of an energy gradient to drive the process.
 At this final stage, death corresponds to the lack of a usable energy gradient
 for cellular processes.
 Thus, reasoning by analogy, free-will, choice is the presence of an energy
 gradient, available to power and perform the result of decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, all of the above needs elaboration; but this is the first time in a
 while that I feel like I'm on the right track.
 Anyway, for now, a plausbile vocabulary item is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choice horizon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so that larger (cellular) energy gradients means more free will.
 Since the gradient must live on a fractal surface to be useful, we need
 a Husdorf-dimension like thing: the gradient across a fractal surface.
 That is, a waterfall has a large energy gradient, but its not doing life-creati
ng work, unless one sticks a water wheel into it.
 Otherwise, most of that work is converted into heat.
 Yes, there's a gradient across the turbulent water motion at the bottom
 of the waterfall, but this quickly thermalizes (ignoring secondary effects
 like the oxygenation of water, or the scrubbing and erosion of rocks, etc.)
 So, for life we need an energy gradient across a turbulent, fractal surface,
 and that surface is stable against long-time mixing/thermalization.
 Huh.
 So that gives a fairly concrete mathematical concept looking for a formal
 definition: a fractal-like dimension thngy describing a gradient across
 a surface that is stable (or slowly varying) over some time frame.
 Huh.
 I wonder if something like this can be found in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets return breifly to the Amazonian rain-forest, brightly-feathered birds
 for for mate-attraction and selection.
 The dance moves, the clothing, the lipstick, the push-up bra, these are
 all creations of spare time and economic wealth, energy funnelled into
 sexy behavior as opposed to raw survival.
 Everyone has at least some energy to spare; there are extreme cases where
 the need for survival really does push out all, almost all non-essential
 activities.
 But even in extreme deprivation, there is some fraction left over for the
 superfluous.
 So this is the inverse or the flip side of free-will of the choice horizon.
 In etreme survival situations, you have mostly no free will, you must do
 what it takes to survive.
 Say, for example, some ocean shipwreck: you have no choice but to swim
 to the nearest island.
 You have some choice in your swimming stroke, or the details of that stroke,
 but you won't expend much mental energy on that, other than to figure out
 what the most energy efficeint swim stroke is (or maybe the fastest if
 your threatened by sharks, as the case may be.) In attempting to find the
 most efficient stroke, you are self-limiting your own choices, for the
 benefit of survival: you won't be swimming the butterfly stroke to get
 out of a jam.
 Only when your survival is ensured, and you are showing off to your girlfreind,
 do you come up with some ornate, spectacular, sublime swimming and diving
 motion: rising from the water, shaking your head and smiling, like what's
 her name in that movie: Perfect Ten, or whatever.
 Hmm.
 But this also is a self-limitation of the range of motion: you are now
 self-limiting for spectacular effect, which, well, in the long run, does
 correlate with species survival.
 Short run, it does not endanger individual survival, and so you can choose
 from a wide range of motions, imaging those, choosing from those that are
 meant to be the most sexually attractive.
 This comes naturally and easily for the normies, who can do this unconsiously,
 without thinking.
 This is problematic for the autists and the social mistfits.
 The dumb ones never get it right, and the smart ones overthink it and fumble.
 The alpha-males, alpha-females are the ones cognizant of what they are
 doing, able to make high-level decisions in optimizing for attractiveness,
 and willfully, consciously become charismatic to their target audience.
 To control their social-perception fate.
 I'm trying not to use the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manipulative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because of its negative overtones.
 But also, manipulative is something else: when I control a person, so as
 to cause them to take some specific action on my behalf (to be my agent),
 as opposed to manipulating their sensory perception infrastructure, to
 perceive me as being beautiful, charming, intelligent, rich, desirable,
 attractive.
 The manipulation of makeup, hair-style and clothing is rather different
 than the manipulation of agency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how much choice is there, if your choices are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

apply makeup or die, socially
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? So the short term choices are very broad (I'm not gonna get out of my
 pyjammas today) vs.
 long term (If I don't look got for this party, I will fail to attract a
 mate, or get a promotion at work, or whatever.) So how do we measure the
 breadth of choices? Choices automatically narrow through time: choices
 freely made today can result in death tomorrow (smoking, drinking, stepping
 in frnot of an oncoming bus.) So we want, well, we don't want a time-weighted
 average of choices, (or do we?) since we can guess, a priori, that most
 choices are dead-ends, are short-tailed and result in a universe with zero
 probability for you, personally.
 We could maybe talk about a choice-volume, weighting timelines by their
 length.
 But if a timeline stops (results in death), we kind of don't want to count
 that timeline as a part of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what choices to I have to stay alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So we really need to count only those choice timelines of infinite (indetermina
te?) length.
 How many choices do I have, right now, that allow me to live forever? This
 is independent of the forecasting ability in determing which choices really
 do let me live forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of this is practical.
 If I want to live forever, I should not choose to step in front of a hurtling
 bus.
 So that one's easy.
 Dietary restrictions are much harder.
 So, in measuring the number of availble choices, I can kind of assume that
 rational future behavior means that if I choose something, anything, right
 now, that allows me to live for one more second, I'll be OK in the future.
 But that's, well that's already problematic, if I choose to smoke a cigarette
 right now.
 I'll live for decades more, but not as long as if I didn't smoke.
 Hmm.
 So there's some rational economic choice theory here, except them there's
 are big words, as no such theory exists in the context I currently am intereste
d in: choices made not just by humans, but by animals, or even simple organisms.
 Or even choices made by cells in my body, whatever little choice they have.
 See, this is the mechanical thing about physics: the 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times10^{23}$
\end_inset

 times my weight in grams atoms, but the number of life-affirming choices
 in from of me are much smaller.
 Millions.
 I'll even grant billions.
 But maybe more like hundreds: I can choose to go fro a walk to the fridge,
 or I can choose to type some more: but whether its hundreds or billions
 of choices, its still a metric fuckton fewer choices than Avaogardo's number.
 And if I tried to count the degrees of freedom for the atoms in my body,
 I get an even sillier large number.
 So most of my body appears to exist in a choiceless mode.
 I've got a relative paucity, as compared to the thermodynamic possibilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what is this mechanism, that allows more than one choice, and yet limits
 the choices to some absurdly tiny fraction of the thermodynamic possibilities?
 This seems to be a key, fundamental question that a theory of free will
 in the physical universe needs to adress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One final note: I've ignored the ecosystem.
 None of this plays out for a single individual or a single group or a single
 species, its an interplay in the ecosystems.
 When there are lots of rabbitts, the hungry wolves have a lot of choices.
 When there are no wolves, the rabitts have lots of choices.
 So perhaps choice-measurement is to be done on ecosystems.
 Again, dyanmical systems.
 But the timescales differ: the fractal constant-energy surfaces in an ecosystem
 are stable in the one-second timescale, because it takes minutes of more
 for a wolf to hunt a rabitt and eat it.
 So the measurement of choice-volme, the choice-horizon, is done at short
 timescales, relative to the dynamics of the ecosystem.
 And so if we ignore large-time ecosystem dynamics, we can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

safely
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 make the simplifying assumption of measuring one individual, taken outside
 of the context of the ecosystem.
 So, timescales matter.

OK, I've been at this, on and off, for nearly eight hours.
 Time to well, I dunno, wrap it up for the day.
 I've done some good emotional processing, up above, and also some theorizing
 that I'm happy with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this highlights the utility of writing in a diary.
 Some of the emotion-processing thoughts, I would have had them anyway,
 but they would have been less focused, less formulated, whispier.
 They might not have gone as deeply, or cut as finely as I have in writing
 the above.
 Ditto for the math/physics theorizing.
 I might have daydreamed up some of this stuff, but without setting it into
 words as I have, it would not have sharpened up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, it seems verbalizing, and conscious, present-tense writing-thinking,
 is an insight sharpener.
 Vague formulations and thoughts happen in a cloud of non-verbatl thought.
 Some of it at the somatic level, certainly, for the feelings of love, and
 of horniness, this is fundamentally somatic.
 But if you want to rationalize things so that it's understandable, communicable
, it does have to be converted into written language (at first step) and
 then to mathematical language, and really, algorithmic, ultimately, if
 we are seeking out AGI operating on silicon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that also offers a little bit of insight into LLM's: they are snapshots
 of the English language.
 So this is a lot more concrete and formalized than the vague, unwritten
 thoughts we all have.
 Some of these vague thoughts might even be dimly visible in the LLM: they
 bleed through into language.
 They have to bleed through: the somatic feelings do get converted into
 words, and poets very much try to chose words that accurately reflect the
 somatic feelings.

I wake up horny every day.
 In the past, (for decades) it was like this too, I suppose.
 But it was sublimated or ignored.
 Occasionally satisfied through masturbation.
 There was no obvious and immediate target of that horniness, and nothing
 could be done, so nothing was done.
 And thus, a placid life, where no turbulent storms of emotion toss the
 shipwrecked soul.
 But now, its different.
 For two or three reasons.
 First, I now have an actual object of my desires.
 Thousands of miles away, but still, an identifiable object.
 An idealized object, but an idealization founded on personal freindship.
 This is not some teenage objectivization of a poster of Farrah Fawcett:
 you don't form freindships with inanimate posters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jeez, my mind zooms in a hundred directions: can one form a relationship
 with an LLM attached to a moving image of a female body? I suppose one
 can: I already skimmed a headline claiming that seniors are less lonely,
 when they get to chat with LLM's.
 This forebodes an entire industry to trick the somatic brain into responding
 to artificial, synthetic beings/creatures as one might respond to other
 humans.
 Again, nothing I write here is new: sci-fi writers have explored this topic.
 As have some small class of academic psychologists.
 It is not my goal here in this diary to make academic advances, but rather
 to process my own emotional, somatic inner life: the process the urges
 and desires of the non-verbal, so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 with my verbal and rational processing cortex.
 I'm told that

 Where was I? In the last paragraph, I wrote

 which is a bit of a shift from my conventional claim that

LLM is just a snapshot of the English Language
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Well, it is.
 But there are also old stories (dating back to Ancient Greece? I don't
 recall.) of scupltors falling in love with their sculptures: it doesn't
 take all that much for the (somatic) brain to respond to stimuli provoking
 a love reaction.
 And marble statues do not even move or talk: an LLM-powered presence can
 be made interactive.
 Is it a being/creature? Well, just the day before, I hypothesized a Hausdorf-di
mension-inspired gradient across turbulent, fractal boundaries.
 I really should work on that to flesh out the details.
 It seems like a really good thing to know and articulate.
 But then, there is also the promise of treasures and gems to be discovered
 in someone elses latest Arxiv post.
 It's really all too much.
 A flood of intellectual stimulous.

But I can't think, because I'm horny and preoccupied with the idea of having
 sex with someone who is thousands of miles away, and is likely to refuse
 my entreaties, anyway.
 Crap.
 It's perhaps amazing that I've managed to suppress sexual desires all these
 decades.
 Is that good, or is that bad? The relative calmness has allowed me to concentra
te on intellectual pursuits.
 The horniness has allowed me to channel urges into sports and physical
 fitness, which just reinforces the horniness.
 I regret only one thing: not having more sex.
 If I could change my life, it would be that.
 But these are just words delivered by my speech center, articulating the
 buried desires of deeper, more primitive, anatomically older parts of my
 brain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An what can I do with my naive conception of neuroanatomy? Daydream of some
 model, involving differential equations, forming feedback loops between
 differrent parts of the brain? What does this get me? Does it enhance my
 longevity? Does it lead to more sex? (No and no.) Does solving this problem
 advance my life in any way? My existing forte is in physics and math; blunderin
g about in the feild of neuroscience is hardly an undertaking to be entered
 into lightly.
 I have a limited lifespan here on Earth, what shall I do with it? Cosmic
 consciousness quantum woo and mind-uploading be damned: neither of these
 seem likely to happen in my remaining life-time, and, at any rate, neither
 cures my current horniness.
 Nor do they ever resolve my future horniness: suppose I've mind-uploaded
 onto a computer.
 Then I get horny.
 Now what? Do I order a silicone dick from Amazon, plug it into the computer,
 and have sex with a Real Doll? This perhaps best illustrates the insanity
 of the concept of mind-uploading: one does not simply upload the soma,
 the somatic drives, the

 part of your brain that wants and desires alcohol, freindship, nicotine,
 sex, LSD, mystical encounters with the majesty supreme, a good cry at the
 end of some rom-com, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
 This is the part of the brain that tends to actually be in charge, actually
 run things, even when we pretend that we are somehow rational and decisive,
 exercising free-will.
 I mean, yes, the neo-cortex can over-ride cruder impulses from more primitive
 anatomical structures: this is after all the whole point of the neocortex:
 an evolutionarily-designed regulator, made to monitor and modulate baser

How strong is this survival drive? Well, if you're hungry enough, you'll
 boil tree bark and eat it.
 But you might be too calorie-starved to make good long-term plans to alleviate
 your hunger (or you might have been born stupid.) Sitting on a tree-stump
 and doing nothing is a rather low-probability outcome for hunger management,
 unless you've managed to exhaust yourself in the hunt, and realized you
 are in the middle of a food desert, and needed a moment to rest (never
 mind what the physiological processes are going on, when you are hungry,
 and resting.
 Maybe some re-apprtionment of calcium from bone to blood, or some clearing
 of lactic acid, or whatever it is that happens during rest.
 Some dynamical process that can be approximated with a set of coupled different
ial eqns model calcium concentrates, lactate buildups, and glossing over
 a more precise and refined model that would specifically localize that
 clciu to some specific muscle group as compared to some other.
 At any rate, we don't have such models, although we can kind of guess at
 what they might be.
 We do not have the technology to tune them to a specific individual or
 a specific instance, or even an age group or fitness level.
 It's like: we can imagine a crude model for the weather, but we can't do
 weather prediction because we don't have precise data on what the body
 is doing.
 BTW: to-do list, I really should get that comprehensive blood-work panel.
 And also deal with prostate concerns.
 Crap too much to do, when all I really want is instant gratification for
 sex with my desired sex object.
 Life is so unfair.)

Where was I? The survival drive for hunger is stronger than that for horniness,
 especially if one has already fixated on a specific sex-object.
 I can't just go out and find a new girlfriend: I would have to nurture
 and culture a freindship, and this is assuming that the initial barrier
 of even meeting someone worthy of attention is overcome.
 So lets review some more details (is this worth thinking about, writing
 about? I dunno, lets find out.) So the relationship with Love Goddess Milda
 is not one where there was some instant contact, but rather, one of the
 slow growth of freindship.
 She was pleasant to be around.
 Even fun, when one or the other of us didn't accidentally ruin the fun.
 And we talked about personal, intimate details.
 Perhaps it is this last that cemented things into place: the intimateness.
 Patty is not intimate.
 She has no curiosity in me.
 We don't talk about things that matter to each other.
 She does not enquire about me, or what I do: frack, she mis-spelled

 WTF.
 Bad decision making on my part, 35 years ago, but at the time, it was the
 best I could do.
 There might not have been any other way, and so here I am.
 Deal with it.
 While with my love goddess (why, I even self-reinforce with my speech!)
 there is ...
 intimacy.
 She does not reveal the daily goings on in her life, and for that I am
 grateful, because it would either be disappointing, or it would further
 some obsession, or might even pluck some cords of jealousy, and all these
 places I don't want to go.
 There is a buffer of mystery, and that is fine.
 Literates through the ages have spoken of the loss of respect when too
 much is revealed.
 Interesting, that.
 Wonder what it implies for, erm, mind-uploading, or mind-melding.
 OK, so I was going to write about how the emotional and psychological intimacy
 with my love goddess is what made me eventually fall in love (ahem, made
 my somatic, reptilian brain fall in love.

 I used to think this ws just some amusing way of talking about love, but

 is how Jeffrey Lee Pierce sings about it in the Gun Club/Fire of Love.
 Shit Fire.
 I was young and I knew not, felt not.
 My genetic complement, my shyness, all this protected me from the wild

 No more.
 I dunno.
 Of course, what I feel now is pale compared to the suffering of others.

 Maybe three, if I had to be precise? I've not yet reached the five-sigma
 level.
 But still, it is a disturbance from the placid place.

 and more immediate forms of pain.
 And again, science has noted that there are more than a few different kinds
 of pain, which can be identified by their biochemical, neurophysiological
 processes.
 But heart-ache remains a mystery to science.
 Perhaps one day, some mechanistic, reductionistic light will be shed on
 it, but certanly not yet.)

intimacy breeds conempt

.
 There are a variety of ways of being intimate; the end-point I want to
 drive to is the rewiring of the global brain via social media.
