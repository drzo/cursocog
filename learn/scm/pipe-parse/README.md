Atomese Pipeline
----------------
Brand-new, still experimental prototype code for pipeline stream
processing. Implements some of the ideas described in the sensory-agents
project, here:

* https://github.com/opencog/sensory
* https://github.com/opencog/agents

The code here tries to satisfy the ideas described there, while still
being usable in the older matrix-API batch-processing system. We're
trying tno to break old code.

### Quick overview:

* __pipe-count.scm__  -- Increments counts on parsed data streams.
