Dead, unused code that might still be interesting.

* __clique-pair-count.scm__: Count all word-pairs that occur in a
    sliding window of some given size. This code used to work, but
    it is not currently interesting. Not used anywhere.

* __clique-pair-count-new.scm__: Some subset of above, worked as a
    stand-in for a while. Unused.

* __batch-clique-pair.scm__: Matrix object API's for "clique pairs" and
    "distance pairs". "Clique pairs" are just counts of pairs in a
    sliding window; we don't do that, we've never seriously done that.
    The "distance pairs" are word pairs that are a fixed distance apart.
    We've never done that.  So its "good code", just unused. Easy to
    recreate, if/when we'd ever need this.

* __utils.scm__: minor pair-construction utilities.
