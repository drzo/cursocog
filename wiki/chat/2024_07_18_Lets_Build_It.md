# Let's Build It - OpenCog System Implementation

## Initial Query
The user requested "Let's Build It!" for the OpenCog system, initiating the development of a comprehensive build system for the OpenCog framework.

## Work Completed

### 1. Build System Implementation
- Created cross-platform build scripts (build.sh and build.ps1)
- Configured unified CMakeLists.txt for all components
- Implemented dependency installation scripts

### 2. Clay UI Integration
- Established directory structure for Clay UI
- Implemented OpenCog-specific renderer
- Created advanced AtomSpace visualization with force-directed graph layout
- Added interactive features for atom manipulation

### 3. Repository Management
- Created repos.txt listing all required components
- Implemented clone_repos.sh and clone_repos.ps1 scripts
- Set up proper repository organization

### 4. Documentation
- Consolidated README files with comprehensive information
- Created detailed .cursor rules for development
- Added progress tracking in TODO.md
- Generated documentation in wiki/chat/

## Component Build Order
1. cogutil
2. atomspace
3. atomspace-storage, atomspace-rocks, atomspace-pgres
4. cogserver
5. learn
6. opencog
7. sensory
8. evidence

## Next Steps
1. Test build system on various platforms
2. Complete Clay UI integration with real AtomSpace implementations
3. Enhance build system performance
4. Implement additional development tools

## Key Files Created
- build.sh and build.ps1 - Main build scripts
- install-dependencies.sh and install-dependencies.ps1 - Dependency installation
- clone_repos.sh and clone_repos.ps1 - Repository management
- clay-ui/* - Visualization components
- .cursor/rules/opencog-build.md - Development guidelines
- TODO.md - Progress tracking

The implementation focuses on creating a unified build system for the entire OpenCog ecosystem, making it easier to build and deploy all components while providing visualization tools through the Clay UI integration.
