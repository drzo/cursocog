# OpenCog Build System Progress Report

## Summary
This document outlines the progress made in implementing a comprehensive build system for the OpenCog framework, following the "Let's Build It!" initiative.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Documentation Consolidation
- Created comprehensive README.md combining information from all component repositories
- Documented component architecture, dependencies, and build procedures
- Added detailed instructions for building on different platforms

### 2. Build System Implementation
- Created a unified CMakeLists.txt file that orchestrates the build of all components
- Established proper dependency relationships between components
- Configured consistent build options and flags across all components

### 3. Dependency Management
- Created installation scripts for Linux/macOS (`install-dependencies.sh`)
- Created installation scripts for Windows (`install-dependencies.ps1`)
- Documented all required dependencies with version information

### 4. Build Scripts
- Implemented shell scripts for Linux/macOS (`build.sh`)
- Implemented PowerShell scripts for Windows (`build.ps1`)
- Added configuration for component-specific builds

### 5. Continuous Integration
- Consolidated CircleCI configuration files from all components
- Created a unified workflow that builds components in the correct dependency order
- Added appropriate test runners for each component

### 6. Repository Management
- Created a list of all required repositories (`repos.txt`)
- Implemented cloning scripts for Linux/macOS (`clone_repos.sh`)
- Implemented cloning scripts for Windows (`clone_repos.ps1`)

### 7. Clay UI Implementation
- Established directory structure for Clay UI integration
- Created download scripts for Clay library
- Implemented CMake configuration for Clay UI
- Created OpenCog-specific renderer for AtomSpace visualization
- Implemented bindings between Clay UI and OpenCog components
- Added example applications demonstrating visualization capabilities

## Current Status
- The basic build system infrastructure is complete
- Clay UI is implemented but needs integration with actual AtomSpace
- Build scripts are ready for testing on actual systems
- Documentation has been consolidated and enhanced

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Verify build system works on various platforms
2. **Integration**: Connect Clay UI visualization with real AtomSpace implementations
3. **Enhancement**: Improve visualization capabilities for complex AtomSpace structures
4. **Performance**: Optimize build process and Clay UI rendering for better performance
5. **Documentation**: Create more detailed developer documentation for the build system

## Technical Details

### Build Order
The components are built in the following order to respect dependencies:
1. cogutil
2. atomspace
3. atomspace-storage, atomspace-rocks, atomspace-pgres
4. cogserver
5. learn
6. opencog
7. sensory
8. evidence

### Clay UI Architecture
The Clay UI implementation provides:
- A force-directed graph visualization for AtomSpace
- Interactive node selection and manipulation
- Physics-based simulation for automatic layout
- Type-based coloring of atoms
- Bindings to connect with real AtomSpace implementations

### Repository Structure
The build system is organized around:
- Root CMakeLists.txt coordinating the builds
- Component-specific build scripts
- Dependency installation scripts
- Clay UI integration for visualization
- Consolidated documentation
