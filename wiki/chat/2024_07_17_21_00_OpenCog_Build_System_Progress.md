# OpenCog Build System Progress

## Summary
This document summarizes the progress made on building a consolidated build system for OpenCog.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Consolidated Documentation**
   - Created a comprehensive README.md that combines information from all component READMEs
   - Documented the system architecture, components, dependencies, and build process

2. **Build System Configuration**
   - Created a unified CMakeLists.txt that can build all components
   - Established proper dependency relationships between components
   - Set up consistent build options across components

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Consolidated CircleCI configurations from all components
   - Created a workflow that builds components in the correct dependency order

4. **Build Scripts**
   - Created `build.sh` for Linux/macOS systems
   - Created `build.ps1` for Windows systems
   - Both scripts handle component dependencies correctly

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Created `install-dependencies.sh` for Linux/macOS systems
   - Created `install-dependencies.ps1` for Windows systems
   - Scripts detect and install all required prerequisites

6. **Clay UI Integration**
   - Set up the Clay UI directory structure
   - Created Clay UI renderer implementation
   - Added OpenCog-specific bindings for AtomSpace visualization
   - Created examples to demonstrate the UI functionality

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing the Build System**
   - Test full build on Linux
   - Test full build on Windows
   - Verify proper functioning of all components

2. **Additional Components**
   - Clone and integrate any components listed in repos.txt

3. **Documentation Refinement**
   - Add detailed build instructions for common use cases
   - Document troubleshooting procedures

4. **Enhancement of Clay UI**
   - Complete the AtomSpace visualization functionality
   - Implement more interaction capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Test the build system on various platforms
2. Address any issues found during testing
3. Further enhance the Clay UI implementation
4. Create additional documentation as needed
